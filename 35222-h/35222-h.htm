<h2><span>White Slavery In The Barbary States.</span></h2>


<p>History has been sometimes called a gallery, where, in living forms, are
preserved the scenes, the incidents, and the characters of the past. It
may also be called the world's great charnel house, where are gathered
coffins, dead men's bones, and all the uncleanness of the years that
have fled. As we walk among its pictures, radiant with the inspiration
of virtue and of freedom, we confess a new impulse to beneficent
exertion. As we grope amidst the unsightly shapes that have been left
without an epitaph, we may at least derive a fresh aversion to all their
living representatives.</p>

<p>In this mighty gallery, amidst a heavenly light, are the images of the
benefactors of mankind&mdash;the poets who have sung the praise of virtue,
the historians who have recorded its achievements, and the good men of
all time, who, by word or deed, have striven for the welfare of others.
Here are depicted those scenes where the divinity of man has been made
manifest in trial and danger. Here also are those grand incidents which
attended the establishment of the free institutions of the world; the
signing of Magna Charta, with its priceless privileges of freedom, by a
reluctant monarch; and the signing of the Declaration of Independence,
the annunciation of the inalienable rights of man, by the fathers of our
republic.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in ignominious confusion, far down in this dark,
dreary charnel house is tumbled all that now remains of the tyrants, the
persecutors, the selfish men, under whom mankind have groaned. Here
also, in festering, loathsome decay, are the monstrous institutions or
customs, which the earth, weary of their infamy and injustice, has
refused to sustain&mdash;the Helotism of Sparta, the Serfdom of Christian
Europe, the Ordeal by Battle, and Algerine Slavery.</p>

<p>From this charnel house let me to-night draw forth one of these. It may
not be without profit to dwell on the <i>origin</i>, the <i>history</i>, and the
<i>character</i> of a custom, which, after being for a long time a byword and
a hissing among the nations, has at last been driven from the world. The
easy, instinctive, positive reprobation, which it will receive from all,
must necessarily direct our judgment of other institutions, yet
tolerated in equal defiance of justice and humanity. I propose to
consider the subject of <i>White Slavery in Algiers</i>, or perhaps it might
be more appropriately called <i>White Slavery in the Barbary States</i>. As
Algiers was its chief seat, it seems to have acquired a current name
from that place. This I shall not disturb; though I shall speak of White
Slavery, or the Slavery of Christians, throughout the Barbary States.</p>

<p>If this subject should fail in interest, it cannot fail in novelty. I am
not aware of any previous attempt to combine its scattered materials in
a connected essay.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/image2.jpg" width="376" height="200" alt="" />
</div>


<p>The territory now known as the Barbary States is memorable in history.
Classical inscriptions, broken arches, and ancient tombs&mdash;the memorials
of various ages&mdash;still bear instructive witness to the revolutions which
it has encountered.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">1</sup></a> Early Greek legend made it the home of terror and
of happiness. Here was the retreat of the Gorgon, with snaky tresses,
turning all she looked upon into stone; and here also the garden of the
Hesperides, with its apples of gold. It was the scene of adventure and
mythology. Here Hercules wrestled with Antæus, and Atlas sustained, with
weary shoulders, the overarching sky. Phoenician fugitives early
transported the spirit of commerce to its coasts; and Carthage, which
these wanderers here planted, became the mistress of the seas, the
explorer of distant regions, the rival and the victim of Rome. The
energy and subtlety of Jugurtha here baffled for a while the Roman
power, till at last the whole country, from Egypt to the Pillars of
Hercules, underwent the process of "annexation" to the cormorant
republic of ancient times. A thriving population and fertile soil
rendered it an immense granary. It was filled with famous cities, one
of which was the refuge and the grave of Cato, fleeing from the
usurpations of Cæsar. At a later day, Christianity was here preached by
some of her most saintly bishops. The torrent of the Vandals, first
wasting Italy, next passed over this territory; and the arms of
Belisarius here obtained their most signal triumphs. The Saracens, with
the Koran and the sword, potent ministers of conversion, next broke from
Arabia, as the messengers of a new religion, and, pouring along these
shores, diffused the faith and doctrines of Mohammed. Their empire was
not confined even by these expansive limits; but, under Musa, entered
Spain, and afterwards at Roncesvalles, in "dolorous rout," overthrew the
embattled chivalry of the Christian world led by Charlemagne.</p>



<p>The Saracenic power did not long retain its unity or importance; and, as
we view this territory, in the dawn of modern history, when the
countries of Europe are appearing in their new nationalities, we discern
five different communities or states,&mdash;Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli,
and Barca,&mdash;the latter of little moment, and often included in Tripoli,
the whole constituting what was then, and is still, called the Barbary
States. This name has sometimes been referred to the Berbers, or
Berebbers, constituting a part of the inhabitants; but I delight to
follow the classic authority of Gibbon, who thinks<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">2</sup></a> that the term,
first applied by Greek pride to all strangers, and finally reserved for
those only who were savage or hostile, has justly settled, as a local
denomination, along the northern coast of Africa. The Barbary States,
then, bear their past character in their name.</p>



<p>They occupy an important space on the earth's surface; on the north,
washed by the Mediterranean Sea, furnishing such opportunities of prompt
intercourse with Southern Europe, that Cato was able to exhibit in the
Roman Senate figs freshly plucked in the gardens of Carthage; bounded on
the east by Egypt, on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the south
by the vast, indefinite, sandy, flinty wastes of Sahara, separating them
from Soudan or Negroland. In the advantages of position they surpass
every other part of Africa,&mdash;unless we except Egypt,&mdash;communicating
easily with the Christian nations, and thus, as it were, touching the
very hem and border of civilization.</p>

<p>Climate adds its attractions to this region, which is removed from the
cold of the north and the burning heats of the tropics, while it is
enriched with oranges, citrons, olives, figs, pomegranates, and
luxuriant flowers. Its position and character invite a singular and
suggestive comparison. It is placed between the twenty-ninth and
thirty-eighth degrees of north latitude, occupying nearly the same
parallels with the Slave States of our Union. It extends over nearly the
same number of degrees of longitude with our Slave States, which seem
now, alas! to stretch from the Atlantic Ocean to the Rio Grande. It is
supposed to embrace about 700,000 square miles, which cannot be far from
the space comprehended by what may be called the <i>Barbary States of
America</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">3</sup></a> Nor does the comparison end here. Algiers, for a long time
the most obnoxious place in the Barbary States of Africa, the chief seat
of Christian slavery, and once branded by an indignant chronicler as
"the wall of the barbarian world," is situated near the parallel of 36°
30' north latitude, being the line of what is termed the Missouri
Compromise, marking the "wall" of Christian slavery, in our country,
west of the Mississippi.</p>



<div class="center">
<img src="images/image3.jpg" width="364" height="185" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Other less important points of likeness between the two territories may
be observed. They are each washed, to the same extent, by ocean and sea;
with this difference, that the two regions are thus exposed on directly
opposite coasts&mdash;the African Barbary being bounded in this way on the
north and west, and our American Barbary on the south and east. But
there are no two spaces, on the surface of the globe, of equal extent,
(and an examination of the map will verify what I am about to state,)
which present so many distinctive features of resemblance; whether we
consider the parallels of latitude on which they lie, the nature of
their boundaries, their productions, their climate, or the "peculiar
domestic institution" which has sought shelter in both.</p>

<p>I introduce these comparisons in order to bring home to your minds, as
near as possible, the precise position and character of the territory
which was the seat of the evil I am about to describe. It might be
worthy of inquiry, why Christian slavery, banished at last from Europe,
banished also from that part of this hemisphere which corresponds in
latitude to Europe, should have intrenched itself, in both hemispheres,
between the same parallels of latitude; so that Virginia, Carolina,
Mississippi, and Texas should be the American complement to Morocco,
Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis. Perhaps the common peculiarities of
climate, breeding indolence, lassitude, and selfishness, may account
for the insensibility to the claims of justice and humanity which have
characterized both regions.</p>

<p>The revolting custom of White Slavery in the Barbary States was, for
many years, the shame of modern civilization. The nations of Europe made
constant efforts, continued through successive centuries, to procure its
<i>abolition</i>, and also to rescue their subjects from its fearful doom.
These may be traced in the diversified pages of history, and in the
authentic memoirs of the times. Literature also affords illustrations,
which must not be neglected. At one period, the French, the Italians,
and the Spaniards borrowed the plots of their stories mostly from this
source.<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">4</sup></a> The adventures of Robinson Crusoe make our childhood familiar
with one of its forms. Among his early trials, he was piratically
captured by a rover from Salle, a port of Morocco, on the Atlantic
Ocean, and reduced to slavery. "At this surprising change of
circumstances," he says, "from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was
perfectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's prophetic
discourse to me, that I should be miserable, and have none to relieve
me, which I thought was so effectually brought to pass, that I could not
be worse." And Cervantes, in the story of Don Quixote, over which so
many generations have shaken with laughter, turns aside from its genial
current to give the narrative of a Spanish captive who had escaped from
Algiers. The author is supposed to have drawn from his own experience;
for during five years and a half he endured the horrors of Algerine
slavery, from which he was finally liberated by a ransom of about six
hundred dollars.<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">5</sup></a> This inconsiderable sum of money&mdash;less than the
price of an intelligent African slave in our own Southern States&mdash;gave
to freedom, to his country, and to mankind the author of Don Quixote.</p>



<div class="center">
<img src="images/image4.jpg" width="253" height="198" alt="" />
</div>



<p>In Cervantes freedom gained a champion whose efforts entitle him to
grateful mention, on this threshold of our inquiry. Taught in the
school of slavery, he knew how to commiserate the slave. The unhappy
condition of his fellow-Christians in chains was ever uppermost in his
mind. He lost no opportunity of arousing his countrymen to attempts for
their emancipation, and for the overthrow of the "peculiar
institution"&mdash;pardon this returning phrase!&mdash;under which they groaned.
He became in Spain what, in our day and country, is sometimes called an
"Anti-Slavery Agitator"&mdash;not by public meetings and addresses, but,
according to the genius of the age, mainly through the instrumentality
of the theatre. Not from the platform, but from the stage, did this
liberated slave speak to the world. In a drama, entitled <i>El Trato de
Argel</i>, or Life in Algiers,&mdash;which, though not composed according to the
rules of art, yet found much favor, probably from its subject,&mdash;he
pictured, shortly after his return to Spain, the manifold humiliations,
pains, and torments of slavery. This was followed by two others in the
same spirit&mdash;<i>La Gran Sultana Dona Cattalina de Oviedo</i>, The Great
Sultana the Lady Cattalina of Oviedo; and <i>Los Banos de Argel</i>, The
Galleys of Algiers. The last act of the latter closes with the
statement, calculated to enlist the sympathies of an audience, that this
play "is not drawn from the imagination, but was born far from the
regions of fiction, in the very heart of truth." Not content with this
appeal through the theatre, Cervantes, with constant zeal, takes up the
same theme, in the tale of the Captive, in Don Quixote, as we have
already seen, and also in that of <i>El Liberal Amante</i>, The Liberal
Lover, and in some parts of <i>La Espanola Inglesa</i>, The English
Spanishwoman. All these may be regarded, not merely as literary labors,
but as charitable endeavors in behalf of human freedom.</p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image5.jpg" width="192" height="191" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And this same cause enlisted also a prolific contemporary genius, called
by Cervantes "that prodigy," Lopé de Vega, who commended it in a play
entitled <i>Los Cautivos de Argel</i>, The Captives of Algiers. At a later
day, Calderon, sometimes exalted as the Shakspeare of the Spanish stage,
in one of his most remarkable dramas, <i>El Principe Constante</i>, The
Constant Prince, cast a poet's glance at Christian slavery in Morocco.
To these works&mdash;belonging to what may be called the literature of
Anti-Slavery, and shedding upon our subject a grateful light&mdash;must be
added a curious and learned volume, in Spanish, on the Topography and
History of Algiers, by Haedo, a father of the Catholic
Church,&mdash;<i>Topografia y Historia de Argel por Fra Haedo</i>,&mdash;published in
1612; and containing also two copious Dialogues&mdash;one on Captivity (<i>de
la Captiudad</i>), and the other on the Martyrs of Algiers, (<i>de los
Martyres de Argel</i>). These Dialogues, besides embodying authentic
sketches of the sufferings in Algiers, form a mine of classical and
patristic learning on the origin and character of slavery, with
arguments and protestations against its iniquity, which may be explored
with profit, even in our day. In view of this gigantic evil,
particularly in Algiers, and in the hope of arousing his countrymen to
the generous work of emancipation, the good father exclaims,<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">6</sup></a> in words
which will continue to thrill the soul,&mdash;so long as a single fetter
binds a single slave,&mdash;"Where is charity? Where is the love of God?
Where is the zeal for his glory? Where is desire for his service? Where
is human pity and the compassion of man for man? Certainly to redeem a
captive, to liberate him from wretched slavery, is the highest work of
charity, of all that can be done in this world."</p>



<div class="center">
<img src="images/image6.jpg" width="181" height="194" alt="" />
</div>


<p>Not long after the dark experience of Cervantes, another person, of
another country and language, and of a still higher character, St.
Vincent de Paul, of France, underwent the same cruel lot. Happily for
the world, he escaped from slavery, to commence at home that long career
of charity&mdash;nobler than any glories of literature&mdash;signalized by
various Christian efforts, against duels, for peace, for the poor, and
in every field of humanity&mdash;by which he is placed among the great names
of Christendom. Princes and orators have lavished panegyrics upon this
fugitive slave; and the Catholic Church, in homage to his extraordinary
virtues, has introduced him into the company of saints. Nor is he the
only illustrious Frenchman who has felt the yoke of slavery. Almost
within our own day, Arago, the astronomer and philosopher,&mdash;devoted
republican, I may add also,&mdash;while engaged, early in life, in those
scientific labors, on the coast of the Mediterranean, which made the
beginning of his fame, fell a prey to Algerine slave dealers. What
science and the world have gained by his emancipation I need not say.</p>

<p>Thus Science, Literature, Freedom, Philanthropy, the Catholic Church,
each and all, confess a debt to the liberated Barbary slave. May they,
on this occasion, as beneficent heralds, commend the story of his
wrongs, his struggles, and his triumphs!</p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image7.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="" />
</div>


<p>These preliminary remarks properly prepare the way for the subject to
which I have invited your attention. In presenting it, I shall naturally
be led to touch upon the <i>origin of slavery</i>, and the principles which
lie at its foundation, before proceeding to exhibit the efforts for its
abolition, and their final success in the Barbary States.</p>

<h3><span>I.</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The word <i>slave</i>, suggesting now so much of human abasement, has an
origin which speaks of human grandeur. Its parent term, <i>Slava</i>,
signifying <i>glory</i>, in the Slavonian dialects, where it first appears,
was proudly assumed as the national designation of the races in the
north-eastern part of the European continent, who, in the vicissitudes
of war, were afterwards degraded from the condition of conquerors to
that of servitude. The Slavonian bondman, retaining his national name,
was known as a <i>Slave</i>, and this term&mdash;passing from a <i>race</i> to a
<i>class</i>&mdash;was afterwards applied, in the languages of modern Europe, to
all in his unhappy lot, without distinction of country or color.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">7</sup></a> It
would be difficult to mention any word which has played such opposite
parts in history&mdash;now beneath the garb of servitude, concealing its
early robes of pride. And yet, startling as it may seem, this word may
properly be received in its primitive character, in our own day, by
those among us who consider slavery essential to democratic
institutions, and therefore a part of the true <i>glory</i> of the country!</p>

<p>Slavery was universally recognized by the nations of antiquity. It is
said by Pliny, in a bold phrase, that the Lacedæmonians "invented
slavery."<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">8</sup></a> If this were so, the glory of Lycurgus and Leonidas would
not compensate for such a blot upon their character. It is true that
they recognized it, and gave it a shape of peculiar hardship. But
slavery is older than Sparta. It appears in the tents of Abraham; for
the three hundred and eighteen servants born to him were slaves. It
appears in the story of Joseph, who was sold by his brothers to the
Midianites for twenty pieces of silver.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">9</sup></a> It appears in the poetry of
Homer, who stamps it with a reprobation which can never be forgotten,

<p>In later days it prevailed extensively in Greece, whose haughty people
deemed themselves justified in enslaving all who were strangers to their
manners and institutions. "The Greek has the right to be the master of
the barbarian," was the sentiment of Euripides, one of the first of her
poets, which was echoed by Aristotle, the greatest of her
intellects.<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">11</sup></a> And even Plato, in his imaginary republic, the Utopia of
his beautiful genius, sanctions slavery. But, notwithstanding these high
names, we learn from Aristotle himself that there were persons in his
day&mdash;pestilent abolitionists of ancient Athens&mdash;who did not hesitate to
maintain that liberty was the great law of nature, and to deny any
difference between the master and the slave; declaring openly that
slavery was founded upon violence, and not upon right, and that the
authority of the master was unnatural and unjust.<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">12</sup></a> "God sent forth
all persons free; nature has made no man a slave," was the protest of
one of these dissenting Athenians against this great wrong. I am not in
any way authorized to speak for any Anti-slavery society, even if this
were a proper occasion; but I presume that this ancient Greek morality
substantially embodies the principles which are maintained at their
public meetings&mdash;so far, at least, as they relate to slavery.</p>


<p>It is true, most true, that slavery stands on force, and not on right.
It is one of the hideous results of war, or of that barbarism in which
savage war plays a conspicuous part. To the victor, it was supposed,
belonged the lives of his captives; and, by consequence, he might bind
them in perpetual servitude. This principle, which has been the
foundation of slavery in all ages, is adapted only to the rudest
conditions of society, and is wholly inconsistent with a period of real
refinement, humanity, and justice. It is sad to confess that it was
recognized by Greece; but the civilization of this famed land, though
brilliant to the external view as the immortal sculptures of the
Parthenon, was, like that stately temple, dark and cheerless within.</p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image8.jpg" width="385" height="167" alt="" />
</div>


<p>Slavery extended, with new rigors, under the military dominion of Rome.
The spirit of freedom which animated the republic was of that selfish
and intolerant character which accumulated privileges upon the Roman
citizen, while it heeded little the rights of others. But, unlike the
Greeks, the Romans admitted in theory that all men were originally free
by the law of nature; and they ascribed the power of masters over slaves
not to any alleged diversities in the races of men, but to the will of
society.<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">13</sup></a> The constant triumphs of their arms were signalized by
reducing to captivity large crowds of the subjugated people. Paulus
Emilius returned from Macedonia with an uncounted train of slaves,
composed of persons in every department of life; and at the camp of
Lucullus, in Pontus, slaves were sold for four drachmæ, or seventy-two
cents, a head. Terence and Phædrus, Roman slaves, have, however, taught
us that genius is not always quenched, even by a degrading captivity;
while the writings of Cato the Censor, one of the most virtuous
slaveholders in history, show the hardening influence of a system which
treats human beings as cattle. "Let the husbandman," says Cato, "sell
his old oxen, his sickly cattle, his sickly sheep, his wool, his hides,
his old wagon, his old implements, <i>his old slave, and his diseased
slave</i>; and if any thing else remains, let him sell it. <i>He should be a
seller, rather than a buyer.</i>"<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">14</sup></a></p>


<p>The cruelty and inhumanity which flourished in the republic, professing
freedom, found a natural home under the emperors&mdash;the high priests of
despotism. Wealth increased, and with it the multitude of slaves. Some
masters are said to have owned as many as ten thousand, while
extravagant prices were often paid, according to the fancy or caprice of
the purchaser. Martial mentions a handsome youth who cost as much as
four hundred sesteria, or sixteen thousand dollars.<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">15</sup></a></p>


<div class="center">

</div>

<p>It is easy to believe that slavery, which prevailed so largely in Greece
and Rome, must have existed in Africa. Here, indeed, it found a peculiar
home. If we trace the progress of this unfortunate continent, from
those distant days of fable, when Jupiter</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i6">did not disdain to grace</span><br />
<span class="i0">The feast of Æthiopia's blameless race,<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">16</sup></a></span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the merchandise in slaves will be found to have contributed to the
abolition of two hateful customs, once universal in Africa&mdash;the eating
of captives, and their sacrifice to idols. Thus, in the march of
civilization, even the barbarism of slavery is an important stage of
Human Progress. It is a point in the ascending scale from cannibalism.</p>


<p>In the early periods of modern Europe, slavery was a general custom,
which yielded only gradually to the humane influences of Christianity.
It prevailed in all the countries of which we have any record.
Fair-haired Saxon slaves from distant England arrested the attention of
Pope Gregory in the markets of Rome, and were by him hailed as <i>angels</i>.
A law of so virtuous a king as Alfred ranks slaves with horses and
oxen; and the chronicles of William of Malmesbury show that, in our
mother country, there was once a cruel slave trade in whites. As we
listen to this story, we shall be grateful again to that civilization
which renders such outrages more and more impossible. "Directly
opposite," he says,<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">17</sup></a> "to the Irish coast, there is a seaport called
Bristol, the inhabitants of which frequently sent into Ireland to sell
those people whom they had bought up throughout England. They exposed to
sale maidens in a state of pregnancy, with whom they made a sort of mock
<i>marriage</i>. There you might see with grief, fastened together by ropes,
whole rows of wretched beings of both sexes, of elegant forms, and in
the very bloom of youth,&mdash;a sight sufficient to excite pity even in
barbarians,&mdash;daily offered for sale to the first purchaser. Accursed
deed! infamous disgrace! that men, acting in a manner which brutal
instinct alone would have forbidden, should sell into slavery their
relations, nay, even their own offspring." From still another
chronicler<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">18</sup></a> we learn that, when Ireland, in 1172, was afflicted with
public calamities, the people, but <i>chiefly the clergy, (præcipue
clericorum,)</i> began to reproach themselves, as well they might,
believing that these evils were brought upon their country because,
<i>contrary to the right of Christian freedom</i>, they had bought as slaves
the English boys brought to them by the merchants; wherefore, it is
said, the English slaves were allowed to depart in freedom.</p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image10.jpg" width="184" height="237" alt="" />
</div>


<p>As late as the thirteenth century, the custom prevailed on the continent
of Europe to treat all captives, taken in war, as slaves. To this,
poetry, as well as history, bears its testimony. Old Michael Drayton, in
his story of the Battle of Agincourt, says of the French,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">For knots of cord to every town they send,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The captived English that they caught to bind;</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>For to perpetual slavery they intend</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Those that alive they on the field should find</i>.</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Othello, in recounting his perils, exposes this custom, when he
speaks</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Of being taken by the insolent foe,</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>And sold to slavery</i>; of my redemption thence.</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was also held lawful to enslave any infidel or person who did not
receive the Christian faith. The early common law of England doomed
heretics to the stake; the Catholic Inquisition did the same; and the
laws of Oleron, the maritime code of the middle ages, treated them "as
dogs," to be attacked and despoiled by all true believers. It appears
that Philip le Bel of France, the son of St. Louis, in 1296, presented
his brother Charles, Count of Valois, with a <i>Jew</i>, and that he paid
Pierre de Chambly three hundred livres for another <i>Jew</i>; as if Jews
were at the time chattels, to be given away, or bought.<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">19</sup></a> And the
statutes of Florence, boastful of freedom, as late as 1415, expressly
allowed republican citizens to hold slaves who were not of the Christian
faith; <i>Qui non sunt Catholicæ fidei et Christianæ</i>.<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">20</sup></a> And still
further, the comedies of Molière, <i>L'Étourdi</i>, <i>Le Sicilien</i>, <i>L'Avare</i>,
depicting Italian usages not remote from his own day, show that, at
Naples and Messina, even Christian women continued to be sold as slaves.</p>



<p>This hasty sketch, which brings us down to the period when Algiers
became a terror to the Christian nations, renders it no longer
astonishing that the barbarous states of Barbary,&mdash;a part of Africa, the
great womb of slavery,&mdash;professing Mohammedanism, which not only
recognizes slavery, but expressly ordains "chains and collars" to
infidels,<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">21</sup></a> should maintain the traffic in slaves, particularly in
Christians who denied the faith of the Prophet. In the duty of constant
war upon unbelievers, and in the assertion of a right to the services or
ransom of their captives, they followed the lessons of Christians
themselves.</p>


<div class="center">

</div>

<p>It is not difficult, then, to account for the origin of the cruel custom
now under consideration. Its <i>history</i> forms our next topic.</p>

<h3><span>II.</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Barbary States, after the decline of the Arabian power, were
enveloped in darkness, rendered more palpable by the increasing light
among the Christian nations. As we behold them in the fifteenth century,
in the twilight of European civilization, they appear to be little more
than scattered bands of robbers and pirates,&mdash;"the land rats and water
rats" of Shylock,&mdash;leading the lives of Ishmaelites. Algiers is
described by an early writer as "a den of sturdy thieves, formed into a
body, by which, after a tumultuary sort, they govern;"<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">22</sup></a> and by still
another writer, contemporary with the monstrosity which he exposes, as
"the theatre of all cruelty and sanctuarie of iniquitie, holding
captive, in miserable servitude, one hundred and twenty thousand Christians, almost all subjects of the
King of Spaine."<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">23</sup></a> Their habit of enslaving prisoners, taken in war
and in piratical depredations, at last aroused against these states the
sacred animosities of Christendom. Ferdinand the Catholic, after the
conquest of Granada, and while the boundless discoveries of Columbus,
giving to Castile and Aragon a new world, still occupied his mind, found
time to direct an expedition into Africa, under the military command of
that great ecclesiastic, Cardinal Ximenes. It is recorded that this
valiant soldier of the church, on effecting the conquest of Oran, in
1509, had the inexpressible satisfaction of liberating upwards of three
hundred Christian slaves.<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">24</sup></a></p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/image12.jpg" width="278" height="187" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The progress of the Spanish arms induced the government of Algiers to
invoke assistance from abroad. At this time, two brothers, Horuc and
Hayradin, the sons of a potter in the Island of Lesbos, had become
famous as corsairs. In an age when the sword of the adventurer often
carved a higher fortune than could be earned by lawful exertion, they
were dreaded for their abilities, their hardihood, and their power. To
them Algiers turned for aid. The corsairs left the sea to sway the land;
or rather, with amphibious robbery, they took possession of Algiers and
Tunis, while they continued to prey upon the sea. The name of
Barbarossa, by which they are known to Christians, is terrible in modern
history.<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">25</sup></a></p>




<p>With pirate ships they infested the seas, and spread their ravages along
the coasts of Spain and Italy, until Charles the Fifth was aroused to
undertake their overthrow. The various strength of his broad dominions
was rallied in this new crusade. "If the enthusiasm," says Sismondi,
"which armed the Christians at an earlier day, was nearly extinct,
another sentiment, more rational and legitimate, now united the vows of
Europe. The contest was no longer to reconquer the tomb of Christ, but
to defend the civilization, the liberty, the lives, of Christians."<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">26</sup></a>
A stanch body of infantry from Germany, the veterans of Spain and Italy,
the flower of the Castilian nobility, the knights of Malta, with a fleet
of near five hundred vessels, contributed by Italy, Portugal, and even
distant Holland, under the command of Andrew Doria, the great sea
officer of the age,&mdash;the whole being under the immediate eye of the
Emperor himself, with the countenance and benediction of the Pope, and
composing one of the most complete armaments which the world had then
seen,&mdash;were directed upon Tunis. Barbarossa opposed them bravely, but
with unequal forces. While slowly yielding to attack from without, his
defeat was hastened by unexpected insurrection within. Confined in the
citadel were many Christian slaves, who, asserting the rights of
freedom, obtained a bloody emancipation, and turned its artillery
against their former masters. The place yielded to the Emperor, whose
soldiers soon surrendered themselves to the inhuman excesses of war. The
blood of thirty thousand innocent inhabitants reddened his victory.
Amidst these scenes of horror there was but one spectacle that afforded
him any satisfaction. Ten thousand Christian slaves met him, as he
entered the town, and falling on their knees, thanked him as their
deliverer.<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">27</sup></a></p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/image13.jpg" width="269" height="184" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the treaty of peace which ensued, it was expressly stipulated on the
part of Tunis, that all Christian slaves, of whatever nation, should be
set at liberty without ransom, and that no subject of the Emperor should
for the future be detained in slavery.<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">28</sup></a></p>

<p>The apparent generosity of this undertaking, the magnificence with which
it was conducted, and the success with which it was crowned, drew to the
Emperor the homage of his age beyond any other event of his reign.
Twenty thousand slaves, freed by treaty, or by arms, diffused through
Europe the praise of his name. It is probable that, in this expedition,
the Emperor was governed by motives little higher than those of vulgar
ambition and fame; but the results with which it was crowned, in the
emancipation of so many of his fellow-Christians from cruel chains,
place him, with Cardinal Ximenes, among the earliest Abolitionists of
modern times.</p>

<p>This was in 1535. Only a few short years before, in 1517, he had granted
to a Flemish courtier the exclusive privilege of importing four thousand
blacks from Africa into the West Indies. It is said that Charles lived
long enough to repent what he had thus inconsiderately done.<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">29</sup></a> Certain
it is, no single concession, recorded in history, of king or emperor,
has produced such disastrous far-reaching consequences. The Fleming
sold his privilege to a company of Genoese merchants, who organized a
<i>systematic</i> traffic in slaves between Africa and America. Thus, while
levying a mighty force to check the piracies of Barbarossa, and to
procure the abolition of Christian slavery in Tunis, the Emperor, with a
wretched inconsistency, laid the corner stone of a new system of slavery
in America, in comparison with which the enormity that he sought to
suppress was trivial and fugitive.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/image14.jpg" width="287" height="156" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Elated by the conquest of Tunis, filled also with the ambition of
subduing all the Barbary States, and of extirpating the custom of
Christian slavery, the Emperor, in 1541, directed an expedition of
singular grandeur against Algiers. The Pope again joined his influence
to the martial array. But nature proved stronger than the Pope and
Emperor. Within sight of Algiers, a sudden storm shattered his proud
fleet, and he was obliged to return to Spain, discomfited, bearing none
of those trophies of emancipation by which his former expedition had
been crowned.<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">30</sup></a></p>



<p>The power of the Barbary States was now at its height. Their corsairs
became the scourge of Christendom, while their much-dreaded system of
slavery assumed a front of new terrors. Their ravages were not confined
to the Mediterranean. They penetrated the ocean, and pressed even to the
Straits of Dover and St. George's Channel. From the chalky cliffs of
England, and even from the distant western coasts of Ireland,
unsuspecting inhabitants were swept into cruel captivity.<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">31</sup></a> The
English government was aroused to efforts to check these atrocities. In
1620, a fleet of eighteen ships, under the command of Sir Robert Mansel,
Vice Admiral of England, was despatched against Algiers. It returned
without being able, in the language of the times, "to destroy those
hellish pirates," though it obtained the liberation of forty "poor
captives, which they pretended was all they had in the towne." "The
efforts of the English fleet were aided," says Purchas, "by a Christian
captive, which did swim from the towne to the ships."<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">32</sup></a> It is not in
this respect only that this expedition recalls that of Charles the
Fifth, which received important assistance from rebel slaves; we also
observe a similar deplorable inconsistency of conduct in the government
which directed it. It was in the year 1620,&mdash;dear to all the descendants
of the Pilgrims of Plymouth Rock as an epoch of freedom,&mdash;while an
English fleet was seeking the emancipation of Englishmen held in bondage
by Algiers, that African slaves were first introduced into the English
colonies of North America&mdash;thus beginning that dreadful system, whose
long catalogue of humiliation and woes is not yet complete.<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">33</sup></a></p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image15.jpg" width="328" height="171" alt="" />
</div>




<p>The expedition against Algiers was followed, in 1637, by another, under
the command of Captain Rainsborough, against Sallee, in Morocco. At his
approach, the Moors desperately transferred a thousand captives, British
subjects, to Tunis and Algiers. "Some Christians, that were slaves
ashore, stole away out of the towne, and came swimming aboard."<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">34</sup></a>
Intestine feud also aided the fleet, and the cause of emancipation
speedily triumphed. Two hundred and ninety British captives were
surrendered; and a promise was extorted from the government of Sallee to
redeem the wretched captives, sold away to Tunis and Algiers. An
ambassador from the King of Morocco shortly afterwards visited England,
and, on his way through the streets of London, to his audience at court,
was attended "by four Barbary horses led along in rich caparisons, and
richer saddles, with bridles set with stones; also some hawks; <i>many of
the captives whom he brought over going along afoot clad in white</i>."<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">35</sup></a></p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/image16.jpg" width="233" height="171" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The importance attached to this achievement may be inferred from the
singular joy with which it was hailed in England. Though on a limited
scale, it had been a <i>war of liberation</i>. The poet, the ecclesiastic,
and the statesman now joined in congratulations on its results. It
inspired the muse of Waller to a poem called <i>The Taking of Sallee</i>, in
which the submission of the slaveholding enemy is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Hither he sends the chief among his peers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who in his bark proportioned presents bears,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To the renowned for piety and force</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Poor captives manumised</i>, and matchless horse.</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It satisfied Laud, and filled with exultation the dark mind of
Strafford. "Sallee, the town, is taken," said the Archbishop in a letter
to the latter, then in Ireland, "and all the captives at Sallee and
Morocco delivered; <i>as many, our merchants say, as, according to the
price of the markets, come to ten thousand pounds, at least</i>."<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">36</sup></a>
Strafford saw in the popularity of this triumph a fresh opportunity to
commend the tyrannical designs of his master, Charles the First. "This
action of Sallee," he wrote in reply to the Archbishop, "I assure you is
full of honor, and should, methinks, <i>help much towards the ready
cheerful payment of the shipping moneys</i>."<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">37</sup></a></p>

<p>The coasts of England were now protected; but her subjects at sea
continued the prey of Algerine corsairs, who, according to the historian
Carte,<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">38</sup></a> now "carried their English captives to France, <i>drove them in
chains overland to Marseilles, to ship them thence with greater safety
for slaves to Algiers</i>." The increasing troubles, which distracted and
finally cut short the reign of Charles the First, could not divert
attention from the sorrows of Englishmen, victims to Mohammedan slave
drivers. At the height of the struggles between the King and Parliament,
an earnest voice was raised in behalf of these fellow-Christians in
bonds.<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">39</sup></a> Waller, who was orator as well as poet, exclaimed in
Parliament, "By the many petitions which we receive from the wives of
those miserable captives at Algiers, (being between four and five
thousand of our countrymen,) it does too evidently appear, that to make
us slaves at home is not the way to keep us from being made slaves
abroad." Publications pleading their cause, bearing date in 1640, 1642,
and 1647, are yet extant.<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">40</sup></a> The overthrow of an oppression so justly
odious formed a worthy object for the imperial energies of Cromwell; and
in 1655,&mdash;when, amidst the amazement of Europe, the English sovereignty
had already settled upon his Atlantean shoulders,&mdash;he directed into the
Mediterranean a navy of thirty ships, under the command of Admiral
Blake. This was the most powerful English force which had sailed into
that sea since the Crusades.<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">41</sup></a> Its success was complete. "General
Blake," said one of the foreign agents of government, "has ratifyed the
articles of peace at Argier, and included therein Scotch, Irish,
Jarnsey, and Garnsey-men, and all others the Protector's subjects. He
has lykewys redeemed from thence al such as wer captives ther. <i>Several
Dutch captives swam aboard the fleet, and so escape theyr
captivity.</i>"<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">42</sup></a> Tunis, as well as Algiers, was humbled; all British
captives were set at liberty; and the Protector, in his remarkable
speech at the opening of Parliament in the next year, announced peace
with the "profane" nations in that region.<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">43</sup></a></p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/image17.jpg" width="259" height="189" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To my mind no single circumstance gives a higher impression of the
vigilance with which the Protector guarded his subjects than this
effort, to which Waller, with the "smooth" line for which he is
memorable, aptly alludes, as</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i3"><i>telling dreadful news</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>To all that piracy and rapine use</i>.</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">His vigorous sway was followed by the effeminate tyranny of Charles the
Second, whose restoration was inaugurated by an unsuccessful expedition
against Algiers under Lord Sandwich. This was soon followed by another,
with a more favorable result, under Admiral Lawson.<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">44</sup></a> By a treaty
bearing date May 3d, 1662, the piratical government expressly
stipulated, "that all subjects of the King of Great Britain, now slaves
in Algiers, or any of the territories thereof, be set at liberty, and

and for the time to come no subjects of his Majesty shall be bought or
sold, or made slaves of, in Algiers or its territories."<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">45</sup></a> Other
expeditions ensued, and other treaties in 1664, 1672, 1682, and

impression produced upon those barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">46</sup></a> Insensible to justice and
freedom, they naturally held in slight regard the obligations of
fidelity to any stipulations in restraint of robbery and slaveholding.</p>



<p>During a long succession of years, complaints of the sufferings of
English captives continued to be made. An earnest spirit, in 1748, found
expression in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">O, how can Britain's sons regardless hear</span><br />
<span class="i0">The prayers, sighs, groans (immortal infamy!)</span><br />

</div>

<p class="noindent">But during all this time, the slavery of blacks, transported to the
colonies under the British flag, still continued.</p>


<p>Meanwhile, France had plied Algiers with embassies and bombardments. In
1635 three hundred and forty-seven Frenchmen were captives there.
Monsieur de Sampson was despatched on an unsuccessful mission, to
procure their liberation. They were offered to him "for the price they
were sold for in the market;" but this he refused to pay.<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">48</sup></a> Next came,
in 1637, Monsieur de Mantel, who was called "that noble captain, and
glory of the French nation," "with fifteen of his king's ships, and a
commission to enfranchise the French slaves." But he also returned,
leaving his countrymen still in captivity.<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">49</sup></a> Treaties followed at a
later day, which were hastily concluded, and abruptly broken; till at
last Louis the Fourteenth did for France what Cromwell had done for
England. In 1684, Algiers, being twice bombarded<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">50</sup></a> by his command,
sent deputies to sue for peace, and to surrender all her Christian
slaves. Tunis and Tripoli made the same submission. Voltaire, with his
accustomed point, declares that, by this transaction, the French became
respected on the coast of Africa, where they had before been known only
as slaves.<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">51</sup></a></p>


<p>An incident is mentioned by the historian, which unhappily shows how
little the French at that time, even while engaged in securing the
emancipation of their own countrymen, had at heart the cause of general
freedom. As an officer of the triumphant fleet received the Christian
slaves who were brought to him and liberated, he observed among them
many English, who, in the empty pride of nationality, maintained that
they were set at liberty out of regard to the King of England. The
Frenchman at once summoned the Algerines, and, returning the foolish
captives into their hands, said, "These people pretend that they have
been delivered in the name of their monarch; mine does not offer them
his protection. I return them to you. It is for you to show what you owe
to the King of England." The Englishmen were again hurried to prolonged
slavery. The power of Charles the Second was impotent in their
behalf&mdash;as was the sense of justice and humanity in the French officer
or in the Algerine government.</p>

<p>Time would fail, even if materials were at hand, to develop the course
of other efforts by France against the Barbary States. Nor can I dwell
upon the determined conduct of Holland, one of whose greatest naval
commanders, Admiral de Ruyter, in 1661, enforced at Algiers the
emancipation of several hundred Christian slaves.<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">52</sup></a> The inconsistency,
which we have so often remarked, occurs also in the conduct of France
and Holland. Both these countries, while using their best endeavors for
the freedom of their white people, were cruelly engaged in selling
blacks into distant American slavery; as if every word of reprobation,
which they fastened upon the piratical, slaveholding Algerines, did not
return in eternal judgment against themselves.</p>

<p>Thus far I have chiefly followed the history of military expeditions.
War has been our melancholy burden. But peaceful measures were also
employed to procure the <i>redemption</i> of slaves; and money sometimes
accomplished what was vainly attempted by the sword. In furtherance of
this object, missions were often sent by the European governments. These
sometimes had a formal diplomatic organization; sometimes they consisted
of fathers of the church, who held it a sacred office, to which they
were especially called, to open the prison doors, and let the captives
go free.<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">53</sup></a> It was through the intervention of the superiors of the
Order of the Holy Trinity, who were despatched to Algiers by Philip the
Second of Spain, that Cervantes obtained his freedom by ransom, in
1579.<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">54</sup></a> Expeditions of commerce often served to promote similar
designs of charity; and the English government, forgetting or
distrusting all their sleeping thunder, sometimes condescended to barter
articles of merchandise for the liberty of their subjects.<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">55</sup></a></p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image19.jpg" width="280" height="201" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Private efforts often secured the freedom of slaves. Friends at home
naturally exerted themselves in their behalf; and many families were
straitened by generous contributions to this sacred purpose. The widowed
mother of Cervantes sacrificed all the pittance that remained to her,
including the dowry of her daughters, to aid in the emancipation of her
son. An Englishman, of whose doleful captivity there is a record in the
memoirs of his son, obtained redemption through the earnest efforts of
his wife at home. "She resolved," says the story, "to use all the means
that lay in her power for his freedom, though she left nothing for
herself and children to subsist upon. She was forced to put to sale, as
she did, some plate, gold rings and bracelets, and some part of her
household goods to make up his ransom, which came to about £150
sterling."<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">56</sup></a> In 1642, four French brothers were ransomed at the price
of six thousand dollars. At this same period, the sum exacted for the
poorest Spaniards was "a thousand shillings;" while Genoese, "if under
twenty-two years of age, were freed for a hundred pounds sterling."<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">57</sup></a>
These charitable endeavors were aided by the cooperation of benevolent
persons. George Fox interceded in behalf of several Quakers, slaves at
Algiers, writing "a book to the Grand Sultan and the King at Algiers,
wherein he laid before them their indecent behavior and unreasonable
dealings, showing them from their Alcoran that this displeased God, and
that Mohammed had given them other directions." Some time elapsed before
an opportunity was found to redeem them; "but, in the mean while, they
so faithfully served their masters, that they were suffered to go loose
through the town, without being chained or fettered."<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">58</sup></a></p>




<div class="center">
<img src="images/image20.jpg" width="199" height="261" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As early as the thirteenth century, under the sanction of Pope Innocent
the Third, an important association was organized to promote the
emancipation of Christian slaves. This was known as the <i>Society of the
Fathers of Redemption</i>.<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">59</sup></a> During many successive generations its
blessed labors were continued, amidst the praise and sympathy of
generous men. History, undertaking to recount its origin, and filled
with a grateful sense of its extraordinary merits, attributed it to the
suggestion of an angel in the sky, clothed in resplendent light, holding
a Christian captive in his right hand, and a Moor in the left. The pious
Spaniard, who narrates the marvel, earnestly declares that this
institution of beneficence was the work, not of men, but of the great
God alone; and he dwells, with more than the warmth of narrative, on the
glory, filling the lives of its associates, as surpassing far that of a
Roman triumph; for they share the name as well as the labors of the
Redeemer of the world, to whose spirit they are the heirs, and to whose
works they are the successors. "Lucullus," he says, "affirmed that it
were better to liberate a single Roman from the hands of the enemy than
to gain all their wealth; but how much greater the gain, more excellent
the glory, and more than human is it to redeem a captive! For whosoever
redeems him not only liberates him from one death, but from death in a
thousand ways, and those ever present, and also from a thousand
afflictions, a thousand miseries, a thousand torments and fearful
travails, more cruel than death itself."<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">60</sup></a> The genius of Cervantes has
left a record of his gratitude to this Anti-Slavery Society<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">61</sup></a>&mdash;the
harbinger of others whose mission is not yet finished. Throughout Spain
annual contributions for its sacred objects continued to be taken for
many years. Nor in Spain only did it awaken sympathy. In Italy and
France also it successfully labored; and as late as 1748, inspired by a
similar catholic spirit, if not by its example, a proposition appeared
in England "to establish a <i>society</i> to carry on the truly charitable
design of emancipating" sixty-four Englishmen, slaves in Morocco.<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">62</sup></a></p>




<p>War and ransom were not the only agents of emancipation. Even if history
were silent, it would be impossible to suppose that the slaves of
African Barbary endured their lot without struggles for freedom.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Since the first moment they put on my chains,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I've thought on nothing but the weight of them,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And how to throw them off.</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These are the words of a slave in the play;<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">63</sup></a> but they express the
natural inborn sentiments of all who have intelligence sufficient to
appreciate the great boon of freedom. "Thanks be to God," says the
captive in Don Quixote, "for the great mercies bestowed upon me; for, in
my opinion, there is no happiness on earth equal to that of liberty
regained."<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">64</sup></a> And plain Thomas Phelps&mdash;once a slave at Machiness, in
Morocco, whence, in 1685, he fortunately escaped&mdash;in the narrative of
his adventures and sufferings, breaks forth in a similar strain. "Since
my escape," he says, "from captivity, and worse than Egyptian bondage, I
have, methinks, enjoyed a happiness with which my former life was never
acquainted; now that, after a storm and terrible tempest, I have, by
miracle, put into a safe and quiet harbor,&mdash;after a most miserable
slavery to the most unreasonable and barbarous of men, now that I enjoy
the immunities and freedom of my native country and the privileges of a
subject of England, although my circumstances otherwise are but
indifferent, yet I find I am affected with extraordinary emotions and
singular transports of joy; now I know what liberty is, and can put a
value and make a just estimate of that happiness which before I never
well understood. Health can be but slightly esteemed by him who never
was acquainted with pain or sickness; and liberty and freedom are the
happiness only valuable by a reflection on captivity and slavery."<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">65</sup></a></p>


<p>The history of Algiers abounds in well-authenticated examples of
<i>conspiracy against the government</i> by Christian slaves. So strong was
the passion for freedom! In 1531 and 1559, two separate plans were
matured, which promised for a while entire success. The slaves were
numerous; keys to open the prisons had been forged, and arms supplied;
but, by the treason of one of their number, the plot was betrayed to the
Dey, who sternly doomed the conspirators to the bastinado and the stake.
Cervantes, during his captivity, nothing daunted by these disappointed
efforts, and the terrible vengeance which awaited them, conceived the
plan of a general insurrection of the Christian slaves, to secure their
freedom by the overthrow of the Algerine power, and the surrender of the
city to the Spanish crown. This was in the spirit of that sentiment, to
which he gives utterance in his writings, that "for liberty we ought to
risk life itself, slavery being the greatest evil that can fall to the
lot of man."<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">66</sup></a> As late as 1763, there was a similar insurrection or
conspiracy. "Last month," says a journal of high authority,<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">67</sup></a> "the
Christian slaves at Algiers, to the number of four thousand, rose and
killed their guards, and massacred all who came in their way; but after
some hours' carnage, during which the streets ran with blood, peace was
restored."</p>



<p>But the struggles for freedom could not always assume the shape of
conspiracies against the government. They were often <i>efforts to
escape</i>, sometimes in numbers, and sometimes singly. The captivity of
Cervantes was filled with such, in which, though constantly balked, he
persevered with determined courage and skill. On one occasion, he
attempted to escape by land to Oran, a Spanish settlement on the coast,
but was deserted by his guide, and compelled to return.<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">68</sup></a> Another
endeavor was favored by a number of his own countrymen, hovering on the
coast in a vessel from Majorca, who did not think it wrong to aid in the
liberation of slaves! Another was promoted by Christian merchants at
Algiers, through whose agency a vessel was actually purchased for this
purpose.<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">69</sup></a> And still another was supposed to be aided by a Spanish
ecclesiastic, Father Olivar, who, being at Algiers to procure the legal
emancipation of slaves, could not resist the temptation to lend a
generous assistance to the struggles of his fellow-Christians in bonds.
If he were sufficiently courageous and devoted to do this, he paid the
bitter penalty which similar services to freedom have found elsewhere,
and in another age. He was seized by the Dey, and thrown into chains;
for it was regarded by the Algerine government as a high offence to
further in any way the escape of a slave.<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">70</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p>Endeavors for freedom are animating; nor can any honest nature hear of
them without a throb of sympathy. As we dwell on the painful narrative
of the unequal contest between tyrannical power and the crushed captive
or slave, we resolutely enter the lists on the side of freedom; and as
we behold the contest waged by a few individuals, or, perhaps, by one
alone, our sympathy is given to his weakness as well as to his cause. To
him we send the unfaltering succor of our good wishes. For him we invoke
vigor of arm to defend, and fleetness of foot to escape. The enactments
of human laws are vain to restrain the warm tides of the heart. We pause
with rapture on those historic scenes, in which freedom has been
attempted or preserved through the magnanimous self-sacrifice of
friendship or Christian aid. With palpitating bosom we follow the
midnight flight of Mary of Scotland from the custody of her stern
jailers; we accompany the escape of Grotius from prison in Holland, so
adroitly promoted by his wife; we join with the flight of Lavalette in
France, aided also by his wife; and we offer our admiration and
gratitude to Huger and Bollman, who, unawed by the arbitrary ordinances
of Austria, strove heroically, though vainly, to rescue Lafayette from
the dungeons of Olmutz. The laws of Algiers&mdash;which sanctioned a cruel
slavery, and doomed to condign penalties all endeavors for freedom, and
all countenance of such endeavors&mdash;can no longer prevent our homage to
Cervantes, not less gallant than renowned, who strove so constantly and
earnestly to escape his chains; nor our homage to those Christians also
who did not fear to aid him, and to the good ecclesiastic who suffered
in his cause.</p>

<p>The story of the efforts to escape from slavery in the Barbary States,
so far as they can be traced, are full of interest. The following is in
the exact words of an early writer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"One John Fox, an expert mariner, and a good, approved, and sufficient
gunner, was (in the raigne of Queene Elizabeth) taken by the Turkes, and
kept eighteen yeeres in most miserable bondage and slavery; at the end
of which time, he espied his opportunity (and God assisting him withall)
that hee slew his keeper, and fled to the sea's side, where he found a
gally with one hundred and fifty captive Christians, which hee speedily
waying their anchor, set saile, and fell to work like men, and safely
arrived in Spaone; by which meanes he freed himselfe and a number of
poor soules from long and intolerable servitude; after which, the said
John Fox came into England, <i>and the Queene (being rightly informed of
his brave exploit) did graciously entertaine him for her servant, and
allowed him a yeerly pension</i>."<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">71</sup></a></p>
</div>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image22.jpg" width="203" height="193" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There is also, in the same early source, a quaint description of what
occurred to a ship from Bristol, captured, in 1621, by an Algerine
corsair. The Englishmen were all taken out except four youths, over whom
the Turks, as these barbarians were often called by early writers, put
thirteen of their own men to conduct the ship as a prize to Algiers; and
one of the pirates, a strong, able, stern, and resolute person, was
appointed captain. "These four poor youths," so the story proceeds,
"being thus fallen into the hands of merciless infidels, began to study
and complot all the means they could for the obtayning of their freedom.
They considered the lamentable and miserable estates that they were like
to be in, as to be debarred forever from seeing their friends and
country, to be chained, beaten, made slaves, and to eat the bread of
affliction in the galleys, all the remainder of their unfortunate lives,
and, which was worst of all, never to be partakers of the heavenly word
and sacraments. Thus, being quite hopeless, and, for any thing they
knew, forever helpless, they sailed five days and nights under the
command of the pirates, when, on the fifth night, God, in his great
mercy, showed them a means for their wished-for escape." A sudden wind
arose, when, the captain coming to help take in the mainsail, two of the
English youths "suddenly took him by the breech and threw him overboard;
but, by fortune, he fell into the bunt of the sail, where, quickly
catching hold of a rope, he, being a very strong man, had almost gotten
into the ship again; which John Cook perceiving, leaped speedily to the
pump, and took off the pump brake, or handle, and cast it to William
Long, bidding him knock him down, which he was not long in doing, but,
lifting up the wooden weapon, he gave him such a palt on the pate, as
made his braines forsake the possession of his head, with which his body
fell into the sea." The corsair slave dealers were overpowered. The four
English youths drove them "from place to place in the ship, and having
coursed them from poop to the forecastle, they there valiantly killed
two of them, and gave another a dangerous wound or two, who, to escape
the further fury of their swords, leaped suddenly overboard to go seek
his captain." The other nine Turks ran between decks, where they were
securely fastened. The English now directed their course to St.&nbsp;Lucas,
in Spain, and "in short time, by God's ayde, happily and safely arrived
at the said port, <i>where they sold the nine Turks for galley slaves, for
a good summe of money, and as I thinke, a great deal more than they
were worth</i>."<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">72</sup></a> "He that shall attribute such things as these," says
the ancient historian, grateful for this triumph of freedom, "to the arm
of flesh and blood, is forgetful, ungrateful, and, in a manner,
atheistical."</p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image23.jpg" width="247" height="246" alt="" />
</div>

<p>From the same authority I draw another narrative of singular success in
achieving freedom. Several Englishmen, being captured and carried into
Algiers, were sold as slaves. These are the words of one of their
number: "<i>We were hurried like dogs into the market, where, as men sell
hacknies in England, we were tossed up and down to see who would give
most for us; and although we had heavy hearts, and looked with sad
countenances, yet many came to behold us, sometimes taking us by the
hand, sometimes turning us round about, sometimes feeling our brawny and
naked armes, and so beholding our prices written in our breasts, they
bargained for us accordingly, and at last we were all sold.</i>" Shortly
afterwards several were put on board an Algerine corsair to serve as
slaves. One of them, John Rawlins, who resembled Cervantes in the
hardihood of his exertions for freedom,&mdash;as, like him, he had lost the
use of an arm,&mdash;arranged a rising or insurrection on board. "O hellish
slavery," he said, "to be thus subject to dogs! O God! strengthen my
heart and hand, and something shall be done to ease us of these
mischiefs, and deliver us from these cruel Mohammedan dogs. What can be
worse? I will either attempt my deliverance at one time or another, or
perish in the enterprise." An auspicious moment was seized; and eight
English slaves and one French, with the assistance of four Hollanders,
freemen, succeeded, after a bloody contest, in overpowering fifty-two
Turks. "When all was done," the story proceeds, "and the ship cleared of
the dead bodies, Rawlins assembled his men together, and with one
consent gave the praise unto God, using the accustomed service on
shipboard, and, for want of books, lifted up their voices to God, as he
put into their hearts or renewed their memories; then did they sing a
psalm, and, last of all, embraced one another for playing the men in
such a deliverance, whereby our fear was turned into joy, and trembling
hearts exhilarated that we had escaped such inevitable dangers, and
especially the slavery and terror of bondage worse than death itself.
The same night we washed our ship, put every thing in as good order as
we could, repaired the broken quarter, set up the biticle, and bore up
the helme for England, where, by God's grace and good guiding, we
arrived at Plimouth, February 17th, 1622."<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">73</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1685, Thomas Phelps and Edward Baxter, Englishmen, accomplished their
escape from captivity in Machiness, in Morocco. One of them had made a
previous unsuccessful attempt, which drew upon him the punishment of the
bastinado, disabling him from work for a twelvemonth; "but such was his
love of Christian liberty, that he freely declared to his companion,
that he would adventure with any fair opportunity." By devious paths,
journeying in the darkness of night, and by day sheltering themselves
from observation in bushes, or in the branches of fig trees, they at
length reached the sea. With imminent risk of discovery, they succeeded
in finding a boat, not far from Sallee. This they took without
consulting the proprietor, and rowed to a ship at a distance, which, to
their great joy, proved to be an English man-of-war. Making known to its
commander the exposed situation of the Moorish ships, they formed part
of an expedition in boats, which boarded and burned them, in the night.
"One Moor," says the account, "we found aboard, who was presently cut in
pieces; another was shot in the head, endeavoring to escape upon the
cable; we were not long in taking in our shavings and tar barrels, and
so set her on fire in several places, she being very apt to receive what
we designed; for there were several barrels of tar upon deck, and she
was newly tarred, as if on purpose. Whilst we were setting her on fire,
we heard a noise of some people in the hold; we opened the scuttles, and
thereby saved the lives of four Christians, three Dutchmen and one
French, who told us the ship on fire was Admiral, and belonged to
Aly-Hackum, and the other, which we soon after served with the same
sauce, was the very ship which in October last took me captive." The
Englishman, once a captive, who tells this story, says it is "most
especially to move pity for the afflictions of Joseph, to excite
compassionate regard to those poor countrymen now languishing in misery
and irons, to endeavor their releasement."<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">74</sup></a></p>



<p>Even the non-resistance of Quakers, animated by a zeal for freedom,
contrived to baffle these slave dealers. A ship in the charge of people
of this sect became the prey of the Algerines; and the curious story is
told with details, unnecessary to mention here, of the effective manner
in which the ship was subsequently recaptured by the crew without loss
of life. To complete this triumph, the slave pirates were safely landed
on their own shores, and allowed to go their way in peace, acknowledging
with astonishment and gratitude this new application of the Christian
injunction to do good to them that hate you. Charles the Second,
learning from the master, on his return, that "he had been taken by the
Turks, and redeemed himself without fighting," and that he had
subsequently let his enemies go free, rebuked him, saying, with the
spirit of a slave dealer, "You have done like a fool, for you might have
had a good gain for them." And to the mate he said, "You should have
brought the Turks to me." "<i>I thought it better for them to be in their
own country</i>" was the Quaker's reply.<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">75</sup></a></p>

<p>In the current of time other instances occurred. A letter from Algiers,
dated August 6, 1772, and preserved in the British Annual Register,
furnishes the following story:<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">76</sup></a> "A most remarkable escape," it says,
"of some Christian prisoners has lately been effected here, which will
undoubtedly cause those that have not had that good fortune to be
treated with utmost rigor. On the morning of the 27th July, the Dey was
informed that all the Christian slaves had escaped the over-night in a
galley; this news soon raised him, and, upon inquiry, it was found to
have been a preconcerted plan. About ten at night, seventy-four slaves,
who had found means to escape from their masters, met in a large square
near the gate which opens to the harbor, and, being well armed, they
soon forced the guard to submit, and, to prevent their raising the city,
confined them all in the powder magazine. They then proceeded to the
lower part of the harbor, where they embarked on board a large rowing
polacre that was left there for the purpose, and, the tide ebbing out,
they fell gently down with it, and passed both the forts. As soon as
this was known, three large galleys were ordered out after them, but to
no purpose. They returned in three days, with the news of seeing the
polacre sail into Barcelona, where the galleys durst not go to attack
her."</p>

<p>In the same journal<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">77</sup></a> there is a record of another triumph of freedom in a letter from Palma, the capital of Majorca, dated
September 3, 1776. "Forty-six captives," it says, "who were employed to
draw stones from a quarry some leagues' distance from Algiers, at a
place named Genova, resolved, if possible, to recover their liberty, and
yesterday took advantage of the idleness and inattention of forty men
who were to guard them, and who had laid down their arms, and were
rambling about the shore. The captives attacked them with pickaxes and
other tools, and made themselves masters of their arms; and, having
killed thirty-three of the forty, and eleven of the thirteen sailors who
were in the boat which carried the stones, they obliged the rest to jump
into the sea. Being then masters of the boat, and armed with twelve
muskets, two pistols, and powder, they set sail, and had the good
fortune to arrive here this morning, where they are performing
quarantine. Sixteen of them are Spaniards, seventeen French, eight
Portuguese, three Italian, one a German, and one a Sardinian."</p>


<p>Thus far I have followed the efforts of European nations, and the
struggles of Europeans, unhappy victims to White Slavery. I pass now to
America, and to our own country. In the name of fellow-countryman there
is a charm of peculiar power. The story of his sorrows will come nearer
to our hearts, and, perhaps, to the experience of individuals or
families among us, than the story of Spaniards, Frenchmen, or
Englishmen. Nor are materials wanting.</p>

<p>Even in the early days of the colonies, while they were yet contending
with the savage Indians, many American families were compelled to mourn
the hapless fate of brothers, fathers, and husbands doomed to slavery in
distant African Barbary. Only five short years after the landing of the
Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock,<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">78</sup></a> it appears from the records of the town,
under date of 1625, that "two ships, freighted from Plymouth, were taken
by the Turks in the English Channel, and carried into Sallee." A little
later, in 1640, "one Austin, a man of good estate," returning
discontented to England from Quinipiack, now New Haven, on his way "was
taken by the Turks, and his wife and family were carried to Algiers,
and sold there as slaves."<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">79</sup></a> And, under date of 1671, in the diary of
the Rev. John Eliot, the first minister of Roxbury, and the illustrious
apostle to the Indians, prefixed to the record of the church in that
town, and still preserved in manuscript, these few words tell a story of
sorrow: "We heard the sad and heavy tidings concerning the captivity of
Captain Foster and his son at Sallee." From further entries in the diary
it appears, that, after a bondage of three years, they were redeemed.
But the same record shows other victims, for whom the sympathies of the
church and neighborhood were enlisted. Here is one: "20 10m. 1674. This
Sabbath we had a public collection for Edward Howard of Boston, to
redeem him out of his sad Turkish captivity, in which collection was
gathered £12 18s. 9d., which, by God's favor, made up the just sum
desired." And not long after, at a date left uncertain, it appears that
William Bowen "was taken by the Turks;" a contribution was made for his
redemption; "and the people went to the public box, young and old, but
before the money could answer the end for which the congregation
intended it," tidings came of the death of the unhappy captive, and the
money was afterwards "improved to build a tomb for the town to inter
their ministers."<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">80</sup></a></p>


<p>Instances now thicken. A ship, sailing from Charlestown, in 1678, was
taken by a corsair, and carried into Algiers, whence its passengers and
crew never returned. They probably died in slavery. Among these was Dr.
Daniel Mason, a graduate of Harvard College, and the earliest of that
name on the list; also James Ellson, the mate. The latter, in a
testamentary letter addressed to his wife, and dated at Algiers, June
30, 1679, desired her to redeem out of captivity two of his
companions.<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">81</sup></a> At the same period William Harris, a person of
consequence in the colony, one of the associates of Roger Williams in
the first planting of Providence, and now in the sixty-eighth year of
his age, sailing from Boston for England on public business, was also
taken by a corsair, and carried into Algiers. On the 23d February, 1679,
this veteran,&mdash;older than the slaveholder Cato when he learned
Greek,&mdash;together with all the crew, was sold into slavery. The fate of
his companions is unknown; but Mr. Harris, after remaining in this
condition more than a year, obtained his freedom at the cost of $1200,
called by him "the price of a good farm." The feelings of the people of
the colony, touched by these disasters, are concisely expressed in a
private letter dated at Boston, New England, November 10, 1680, where it
is said, "The Turks have so taken our New England ships richly loaden
homeward bound, that it is very dangerous to goe. Many of our neighbors
are now in captivity in Argeer. The Lord find out some way for their
redemption."<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">82</sup></a></p>

<p>Still later, as we enter the next century, we meet a curious notice of
the captivity of a Bostonian. Under date of Tuesday, January 11, 1714,
Chief Justice Samuel Sewell, in his journal, after describing a dinner
with Mr. Gee, and mentioning the guests, among whom were the famous
divines, Increase and Cotton Mather, adds, "It seems it was in
remembrance of his landing this day at Boston, after his Algerine
captivity. Had a good treat. Dr. Cotton Mather, in returning thanks,
very well comprised many weighty things very pertinently."<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">83</sup></a> Among the
many weighty things very pertinently comprised by this eminent preacher,
in returning thanks, it is hoped, was a condemnation of slavery. Surely
he could not then have shrunk from giving utterance to that faith which
preaches deliverance to the captive.</p>




<p>But leaving the imperfect records of colonial days, I descend at once to
that period, almost in the light of these times, when our National
Government, justly careful of the liberty of its white citizens, was
aroused to put forth all its power in their behalf. The war of the
Revolution closed in 1783, by the acknowledgment of the independence of
the United States. The new national flag, then freshly unfurled, and
hardly known to the world, seemed to have little power to protect
persons or property from the outrages of the Barbary States. Within
three years, no less than ten American vessels became their prey. At one
time an apprehension prevailed, that Dr. Franklin had been captured. "We
are waiting," said one of his French correspondents, "with the greatest
patience to hear from you. The newspapers have given us anxiety on your
account; for some of them insist that you have been taken by the
Algerines, while others pretend that you are at Morocco, enduring your
slavery with all the patience of a philosopher."<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">84</sup></a> The property of our
merchants was sacrificed or endangered. Insurance at Lloyd's, in London,
could be had only at advanced prices; while it was difficult to obtain
freight for American bottoms.<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">85</sup></a> The Mediterranean trade seemed closed
to our enterprise. To a people filled with the spirit of commerce, and
bursting with new life, this in itself was disheartening; but the
sufferings of our unhappy fellow-citizens, captives in a distant land,
aroused a feeling of a higher strain.</p>



<p>As from time to time the tidings of these things reached America, a
voice of horror and indignation swelled through the land. The slave
corsairs of African Barbary were branded sometimes as "infernal crews,"
sometimes as "human harpies."<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">86</sup></a> This sentiment acquired new force,
when, at two different periods, by the fortunate escape of captives,
what seemed an authentic picture of their condition was presented to the
world. The story of these fugitives will show at once the hardships of
their lot, and the foundation of the appeal which was soon made to the
country with so much effect.</p>


<p>The earliest of these escapes was in 1788, by a person originally
captured in a vessel from Boston. At Algiers he had been, with the rest
of the ship's company, exposed for sale at public auction, whence he was
sent to the country house of his master, about two miles from town.
Here, for the space of eighteen months, he was chained to the
wheelbarrow, and allowed only one pound of bread a day, during all which
wretched period he had no opportunity to learn the fate of his
companions. From the country he was removed to Algiers, where, in a
numerous company of white slaves, he encountered three of his shipmates,
and twenty-six other Americans. After remaining for some time crowded
together in the slave prison, they were all distributed among the
different galleys in the service of the Dey. Our fugitive, with eighteen
other white slaves, was put on board a xebec, carrying eight
six-pounders and sixty men, which, on the coast of Malta, encountered an
armed vessel belonging to Genoa, and, after much bloodshed, was taken
sword in hand. Eleven of the unfortunate slaves, compelled to this
unwelcome service in the cause of a tyrannical master, were killed in
the contest, before the triumph of the Genoese could deliver them from
their chains. Our countryman and the few still alive were at once set at
liberty, and, it is said, "treated with that humanity which
distinguishes the Christian from the barbarian."<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">87</sup></a></p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image27.jpg" width="238" height="236" alt="" />
</div>




<p>His escape was followed in the next year by that of several others,
achieved under circumstances widely different. They had entered, about
five years before, on board a vessel belonging to Philadelphia, which
was captured near the Western Islands, and carried into Algiers. The
crew, consisting of twenty persons, were doomed to bondage. Several were
sent into the country and chained to work with the mules. Others were
put on board a galley and chained to the oars. The latter, tempted by
the facilities of their position near the sea, made several attempts to
escape, which for some time proved fruitless. At last, the love of
freedom triumphing over the suggestions of humanity, they rose upon
their overseers; some of whom they killed, and confined others. Then,
seizing a small galley of their masters, they set sail for Gibraltar,
where in a few hours they landed as freemen.<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">88</sup></a> Thus, by killing their
keepers and carrying off property not their own, did these fugitive
white slaves achieve their liberty.</p>



<p>Such stories could not be recounted without producing a strong effect.
The glimpses thus opened into the dread regions of slavery gave a
harrowing reality to all that conjecture or imagination had pictured. It
was, indeed, true, that our own white brethren, heirs to the freedom
newly purchased by precious blood, partakers in the sovereignty of
citizenship, belonging to the fellowship of the Christian church, were
degraded in unquestioning obedience to an arbitrary taskmaster, sold as
beasts of the field, and galled by the manacle and the lash! It was true
that they were held at fixed prices; and that their only chance of
freedom was to be found in the earnest, energetic, united efforts of
their countrymen in their behalf. It is not easy to comprehend the exact
condition to which they were reduced. There is no reason to believe that
it differed materially from that of other Christian captives in Algiers.
The masters of vessels were lodged together, and indulged with a table
by themselves, though a small iron ring was attached to one of their
legs, to denote that they were slaves. The seamen were taught and
obliged to work at the trade of carpenter, blacksmith, and stone mason,
from six o'clock in the morning till four o'clock in the afternoon,
without intermission, except for half an hour at dinner.<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">89</sup></a> Some of the
details of their mode of life, as transmitted to us, are doubtless
exaggerated. It is, however, sufficient to know that they were slaves;
nor is there any other human condition, which, when barely mentioned,
even without one word of description, so strongly awakens the sympathies
of every just and enlightened lover of his race.</p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image28.jpg" width="299" height="153" alt="" />
</div>

<p>With a view to secure their freedom, informal agencies were soon
established under the direction of our minister at Paris; and the
<i>Society of Redemption</i>&mdash;whose beneficent exertions, commencing so early
in modern history, were still continued&mdash;offered their aid. Our agents
were blandly entertained by that great slave dealer, the Dey of Algiers, who informed
them that he was familiar with the exploits of Washington, and, as he
never expected to see him, expressed a hope, that, through Congress, he
might receive a full-length portrait of this hero of freedom, to be
displayed in his palace at Algiers. He, however, still clung to his
American slaves, holding them at prices beyond the means of the agents.
These, in 1786, were $6000 for a master of a vessel, $4000 for a mate,
$4000 for a passenger, and $1400 for a seaman; whereas the agents were
authorized to offer only $200 for each captive.<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">90</sup></a> In 1790, the tariff
of prices seems to have fallen. Meanwhile, one obtained his freedom
through private means, others escaped, and others still were liberated
by the great liberator Death. The following list, if not interesting
from the names of the captives, will at least be curious as evidence of
the sums demanded for them in the slave market:<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">91</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1793, there were one hundred and fifteen American slaves in
Algiers.<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">92</sup></a> Their condition excited the fraternal feeling of the whole
people, while it occupied the anxious attention of Congress and the
prayers of the clergy. A petition dated at Algiers, December 29, 1793,
was addressed to the House of Representatives, by these unhappy
persons.<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">93</sup></a> "Your petitioners," it says, "are at present captives in
this city of bondage, employed daily in the most laborious work, without
any respect to persons. They pray that you will take their unfortunate
situation into consideration, and adopt such measures as will restore
the American captives to their country, their friends, families, and
connections; and your petitioners will ever pray and be thankful." But
the action of Congress was sluggish, compared with the swift desires of
all lovers of freedom.</p>





<p>Appeals of a different character, addressed to the country at large,
were now commenced. These were efficiently aided by a letter to the
American people, dated Lisbon, July 11, 1794, from Colonel Humphreys,
the friend and companion of Washington, and at that time our minister to
Portugal. Taking advantage of the general interest in lotteries, and
particularly of the custom, not then condemned, of resorting to these as
a mode of obtaining money for literary or benevolent purposes, he
suggested a grand lottery, sanctioned by the United States, or
particular lotteries in the individual states, in order to obtain the
means required to purchase the freedom of our countrymen. He then asks,
"Is there within the limits of these United States an individual who
will not cheerfully contribute, in proportion to his means, to carry it
into effect? By the peculiar blessings of freedom which you enjoy, by
the disinterested sacrifices you made for its attainment, by the
patriotic blood of those martyrs of liberty who died to secure your
independence, and by all the tender ties of nature, let me conjure you
once more to snatch your unfortunate countrymen from fetters, dungeons,
and death."</p>

<p>This appeal was followed shortly after by a petition from the American
captives in Algiers, addressed to the ministers of the gospel of every
denomination throughout the United States, praying their help in the
sacred cause of Emancipation. It begins by an allusion to the day of
national thanksgiving appointed by President Washington, and proceeds to
ask the clergy to set apart the Sunday preceding that day for sermons,
to be delivered contemporaneously throughout the country in behalf of
their brethren in bonds.<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">94</sup></a></p>

"In the tenth year of his captivity."</p>
</div>


<p>The cause in which this document was written will indispose the candid
reader to any criticism of its somewhat exuberant language. Like the
drama of Cervantes, setting forth the horrors of the galleys of Algiers,
"it was not drawn from the imagination, but was born far from the
regions of fiction, in the very heart of truth." Its earnest appeals
were calculated to touch the soul, and to make the very name of slavery
and slave dealer detestable.</p>



<p>And here I should do injustice to the truth of history, if I did not
suspend for one moment the narrative of this Anti-Slavery movement, in
order to exhibit the pointed parallels then extensively recognized
between Algerine and American slavery. The conscientious man could not
plead in behalf of the emancipation of his white fellow-citizens,
without confessing in his heart, perhaps to the world, that every
consideration, every argument, every appeal urged for the white man,
told with equal force in behalf of his wretched colored brother in
bonds. Thus the interest awakened for the slave in Algiers embraced also
the slave at home. Sometimes they were said to be alike in condition;
sometimes, indeed, it was openly declared that the horrors of our
American slavery surpassed that of Algiers.</p>

<p>John Wesley, the oracle of Methodism, addressing those engaged in the
negro slave trade, said, as early as 1772, "You have carried the
survivors into the vilest of slavery, never to end but with life&mdash;<i>such
slavery as is not found among the Turks at Algiers</i>."<a id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">95</sup></a> And another
writer, in 1794, when the sympathy with the American captives was at its
height, presses the parallel in pungent terms: "For this practice of
buying and selling slaves," he says, "we are not entitled to charge the
Algerines with any exclusive degree of barbarity. The Christians of
Europe and America carry on this commerce one hundred times more
extensively than the Algerines. It has received a recent sanction from
the immaculate Divan of Britain. Nobody seems even to be surprised by a
diabolical kind of advertisements, which, for some months past, have
frequently adorned the newspapers of Philadelphia. The French fugitives
from the West Indies have brought with them a crowd of slaves. These
most injured people sometimes run off, and their master advertises a
reward for apprehending them. At the same time, we are commonly informed
that his sacred name is marked in capitals on their breasts; or, in
plainer terms, it is stamped on that part of the body with a red-hot
iron. Before, therefore, we reprobate the ferocity of the Algerines, we
should inquire whether it is not possible to find in some other region
of this globe a systematic brutality still more disgraceful."<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">96</sup></a></p>




<p>Not long after the address to the clergy by the captives in Algiers, a
publication appeared in New Hampshire, entitled "Tyrannical Libertymen;
a Discourse upon Negro Slavery in the United States, composed at &mdash;&mdash; in
New Hampshire on the late Federal Thanksgiving Day,"<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">97</sup></a> which does not
hesitate to brand American slavery in terms of glowing reprobation.
"There was a contribution upon this day," it says, "for the purpose of
redeeming those Americans who are in slavery at Algiers&mdash;an object
worthy of a generous people. Their redemption, we hope, is not far
distant. But should any person contribute money for this purpose which
he had cudgelled out of a negro slave, he would deserve less applause
than an actor in the comedy of Las Casas.... When will Americans show
that they are what they affect to be thought&mdash;friends to the cause of
humanity at large, reverers of the rights of their fellow-creatures?
Hitherto we have been oppressors; nay, murderers! for many a negro has
died by the whip of his master, and many have lived when death would
have been preferable. Surely the curse of God and the reproach of man is
against us. Worse than the seven plagues of Egypt will befall us. If
Algiers shall be punished sevenfold, truly America seventy and
sevenfold."</p>


<p>To the excitement of this discussion we are indebted for the story of
"The Algerine Captive;" a work to which, though now forgotten, belongs
the honor of being among the earliest literary productions of our
country reprinted in London, at a time when few American books were
known abroad. It was published anonymously, but is known to have been
written by Royall Tyler, afterwards Chief Justice of Vermont. In the
form of a narrative of personal adventures, extending through two
volumes, as a slave in Algiers, the author depicts the horrors of this
condition. In this regard it is not unlike the story of "Archy Moore,"
in our own day, displaying the horrors of American slavery. The author,
while engaged as surgeon on board a ship in the African slave trade, is
taken captive by the Algerines. After describing the reception of the
poor negroes, he says, "I cannot reflect on this transaction yet without
shuddering. I have deplored my conduct with tears of anguish; and I pray
a merciful God, the common Parent of the great family of the universe,
who hath made of one flesh and one blood all nations of the earth, that
the miseries, the insults, and cruel woundings I afterwards received,
when a slave myself, may expiate for the inhumanity I was necessitated
to exercise towards these my brethren of the human race."<a id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">98</sup></a> And when
at length he is himself made captive by the Algerines, he records his
meditations and resolves. "Grant me," he says, from the depths of his
own misfortune, "once more to taste the freedom of my native country,
and every moment of my life shall be dedicated to preaching against this
detestable commerce. I will fly to our fellow-citizens in the Southern
States; I will, on my knees, conjure them, in the name of humanity, to
abolish a traffic which causes it to bleed in every pore. If they are
deaf to the pleadings of nature, I will conjure them, for the sake of
consistency, to cease to deprive their fellow-creatures of freedom,
which their writers, their orators, representatives, senators, and even
their constitutions of government, have declared to be the unalienable
birthright of man."<a id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">99</sup></a></p>


<p>But this comparison was presented not merely in the productions of
literature, or in fugitive essays. It was distinctly set forth, on an
important occasion, in the diplomacy of our country, by one of her most
illustrious citizens. Complaint had been made against England for
carrying away from New York certain negroes, in alleged violation of the
treaty of 1783. In an elaborate paper discussing this matter, John Jay,
at that time, under the Confederation, Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
says, "Whether men can be so degraded as, under any circumstances, to be
with propriety denominated <i>goods and chattels</i>, and, under that idea,
capable of becoming <i>booty</i>, is a question on which opinions are
unfortunately various, even in countries professing Christianity and
respect for the rights of mankind." He then proceeds, in words worthy of
special remembrance at this time: "If a war should take place between
France and Algiers, and in the course of it France should invite the
American slaves there to run away from their masters, and actually
receive and protect them in their camp, what would Congress, and indeed
the world, think and say of France, if, in making peace with Algiers,
she should give up those American slaves to their former Algerine
masters? <i>Is there any difference between the two cases than this</i>,
viz., <i>that the American slaves at Algiers are</i> <span class="smcap">WHITE</span> <i>people, whereas
the African slaves at New York were</i> <span class="smcap">BLACK</span> <i>people</i>?" In introducing
these sentiments, the Secretary remarks, "He is aware he is about to say
unpopular things; but higher motives than personal considerations press
him to proceed."<a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">100</sup></a> Words worthy of John Jay!</p>

<p>The same comparison was also presented by the Abolition Society of
Pennsylvania, in an Address, in 1787, to the Convention which framed the
Federal Constitution. "Providence," it says, "seems to have ordained the
sufferings of our American brethren, groaning in captivity at Algiers,
to awaken us to a sentiment of the injustice and cruelty of which we are
guilty towards the wretched Africans."<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">101</sup></a> Shortly afterwards, it was
again brought forward by Dr. Franklin, in an ingenious apologue, marked
by his peculiar humor, simplicity, logic, and humanity. As President of
the same Abolition Society, which had already addressed the Convention,
he signed a memorial to the earliest Congress under the Constitution,
praying it "to countenance the restoration of liberty to those unhappy
men, who alone, in this land of freedom, are degraded into perpetual
bondage; and to step to the <i>very verge</i> of the power vested in them for
<i>discouraging</i> every species of traffic in the persons of our
fellow-men." In the debates which ensued on the presentation of this
memorial,&mdash;memorable not only for its intrinsic importance as a guide to
the country, but as the final public act of one of the chief founders of
our national institutions,&mdash;several attempts were made to justify
slavery and the slave trade. The last and almost dying energies of
Franklin were excited. In a remarkable document, written only
twenty-four days before his death, and published in the journals of the
time, he gave a parody of a speech actually delivered in the American
Congress&mdash;transferring the scene to Algiers, and putting the American
speech in the mouth of a corsair slave dealer, in the Divan at that
place. All the arguments adduced in favor of negro slavery are applied
by the Algerine orator with equal force to justify the plunder and
enslavement of whites.<a id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">102</sup></a> With this protest against a great wrong,
Franklin died.</p>




<p>Most certainly we shall be aided, at least in our appreciation of
American slavery, when we know that it was likened, by characters like
Wesley, Jay, and Franklin, to the abomination of slavery in Algiers. But
whatever may have been the influence of this parallel on the condition
of the black slaves, it did not check the rising sentiments of the
people against White Slavery.</p>



<p>The country was now aroused. A general contribution was proposed for the
emancipation of our brethren. Their cause was pleaded in churches, and
not forgotten at the festive board. At all public celebrations, the
toasts, "Happiness for all," and "Universal Liberty," were proposed, not
less in sympathy with the efforts for freedom in France than with those
for our own wretched white fellow-countrymen in bonds. On at least one
occasion,<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">103</sup></a> they were distinctly remembered in the following toast:
"Our brethren in slavery at Algiers. May the measures adopted for their
redemption be successful, and may they live to rejoice with their
friends in the blessings of liberty."</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the earnest efforts of our government were continued. In his
message to Congress, bearing date December 8, 1795, President Washington
said, "With peculiar satisfaction I add, that information has been
received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers, importing that
the terms of the treaty with the Dey and regency of that country have
been adjusted in such a manner as to authorize the expectation of a
speedy peace, and the restoration of our unfortunate fellow-citizens
from a grievous captivity." This, indeed, had been already effected on
the 5th of September, 1795.<a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">104</sup></a> It was a treaty full of humiliation for
the <i>chivalry</i> of our country. Besides securing to the Algerine
government a large sum, in consideration of present peace and the
liberation of the captives, it stipulated for an annual tribute from the
United States of twenty-one thousand dollars. But feelings of pride
disappeared in heartfelt satisfaction. It is recorded that a thrill of
joy went through the land when it was announced that a vessel had left
Algiers, having on board all the Americans who had been in captivity
there. Their emancipation was purchased at the cost of upwards of seven
hundred thousand dollars. But the largess of money, and even the
indignity of tribute, were forgotten in gratulations on their new-found
happiness. The President, in a message to Congress, December 7, 1796,
presented their "actual liberation" as a special subject of joy "to
every feeling heart." Thus did our government construct a Bridge of Gold
for freedom.</p>



<p>This act of national generosity was followed by peace with Tripoli,
purchased November 4, 1796, for the sum of fifty thousand dollars, under
the guaranty of the Dey of Algiers, who was declared to be "the mutual
friend of the parties." By an article in this treaty, negotiated by Joel
Barlow,&mdash;out of tenderness, perhaps, to Mohammedanism, and to save our
citizens from the slavery which was regarded as the just doom of
"Christian dogs,"&mdash;it was expressly declared that "the government of the
United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian
religion."<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">105</sup></a>
At a later day, by a treaty with Tunis, purchased after
some delay, but at a smaller price than that with Tripoli, all danger to
our citizens seemed to be averted. In this treaty it was ignominiously
provided, that fugitive slaves, taking refuge on board American merchant
vessels, and even vessels of war, should be restored to their
owners.<a id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">106</sup></a></p>




<div class="center">
<img src="images/image29.jpg" width="274" height="201" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As early as 1787, a treaty of a more liberal character had been entered
into with Morocco, which was confirmed in 1795,<a id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">107</sup></a> at the price of
twenty thousand dollars; while, by a treaty with Spain, in 1799, this
slave-trading empire <i>expressly declared its desire that the name of
slavery might be effaced from the memory of man</i>.<a id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">108</sup></a></p>




<p>But these governments were barbarous, faithless, and regardless of the
duties of humanity and justice. Treaties with them were evanescent. As
in the days of Charles the Second, they seemed made merely to be broken.
They were observed only so long as money was derived under their
stipulations. Our growing commerce was soon again fatally vexed by the
Barbary corsairs, who now compelled even the ships of our navy to submit
to peculiar indignities. In 1801, the Bey of Tripoli formally declared
war against the United States, and in token thereof "our flagstaff
[before the consulate] was chopped down six feet from the ground, and
left reclining on the terrace."<a id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">109</sup></a> Our citizens once more became the
prize of man-stealers. Colonel Humphreys, now at home in retirement, was
aroused. In an address to the public, he called again for united action,
saying, "Americans of the United States, your fellow-citizens are in
fetters! Can there be but one feeling? Where are the gallant remains of
the race who fought for freedom? Where the glorious heirs of their
patriotism? <i>Will there never be a truce between political parties? Or
must it forever be the fate of</i> <span class="smcap">Free States</span>, <i>that the soft voice of
union should be drowned in the hoarse clamors of discord?</i> No! Let every
friend of blessed humanity and sacred freedom entertain a better hope
and confidence."<a id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">110</sup></a> Colonel Humphreys was not a statesman only; he was
known as a poet also. And in this character he made another appeal to
his country. In a poem on "The Future Glory of the United States," he
breaks forth into an indignant condemnation of slavery, which, whatever
may be the merits of its verse, should not be omitted here.</p>

<p>The people and government responded to this voice. And here commenced
those early deeds by which our navy became known in Europe. The frigate
Philadelphia, through a reverse of shipwreck rather than war, falling
into the hands of the Tripolitans, was, by a daring act of Decatur,
burned under the guns of the enemy. Other feats of hardihood ensued. A
romantic expedition by General Eaton, from Alexandria, in
Egypt, across the desert of Libya, captured Derne. Three several times
Tripoli was attacked, and, at last, on the 3d of June, 1805, entered
into a treaty, by which it was stipulated that the United States should
pay sixty thousand dollars for the freedom of two hundred American
slaves; and that, in the event of future war between the two countries,
prisoners should not be reduced to slavery, but should be exchanged rank
for rank; and if there were any deficiency on either side, it should be
made up by the payment of five hundred Spanish dollars for each captain,
three hundred dollars for each mate and supercargo, and one hundred
dollars for each seaman.<a id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">112</sup></a> Thus did our country, after successes not
without what is called the glory of arms, again purchase by money the
emancipation of her white citizens.</p>



<div class="center">
<img src="images/image30.jpg" width="290" height="155" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The power of Tripoli was, however, inconsiderable. That of Algiers was
more formidable. It is not a little curious that the largest ship of
this slave-trading state was the Crescent, of thirty-four guns, built in
New Hampshire;<a id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">113</sup></a> <i>though it is hardly to the credit of our sister
State that the Algerine power derived such important support from her</i>.
The lawlessness of the corsair again broke forth by the seizure, in
1812, of the brig Edwin, of Salem, and the enslavement of her crew. All
the energies of the country were at this time enlisted in war with Great
Britain; but, even amidst the anxieties of this gigantic contest, the
voice of these captives was heard, awakening a corresponding sentiment
throughout the land, until the government was prompted to seek their
release. Through Mr. Noah, recently appointed consul at Tunis, it
offered to purchase their freedom at three thousand dollars a head.<a id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">114</sup></a>
The answer of the Dey, repeated on several occasions, was, that "not for
two millions of dollars would he sell his American slaves."<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">115</sup></a> The
timely treaty of Ghent, in 1815, establishing peace with Great Britain,
left us at liberty to deal with this enslaver of our countrymen. A naval
force was promptly despatched to the Mediterranean, under Commodore
Bainbridge and Commodore Decatur. The rapidity of their movements and
their striking success had the desired effect. In June, 1815, a treaty
was extorted from the Dey of Algiers, by which, after abandoning all
claim to tribute in any form, he delivered his American captives, ten in
number, without any ransom; and stipulated, that hereafter no Americans
should be made slaves or forced to hard labor, and still further, that
"any Christians whatever, captives in Algiers," making their escape and
taking refuge on board an American ship of war, should be safe from all
requisition or reclamation.<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">116</sup></a></p>



<p>It is related of Decatur, that he walked his deck with impatient
earnestness, awaiting the promised signature of the treaty. "Is the
treaty signed?" he cried to the captain of the port and the Swedish
consul, as they reached the Guerriere with a white flag of truce. "It
is," replied the Swede; and the treaty was placed in Decatur's hands.
"Are the prisoners in the boat?" "They are." "Every one of them?" "Every
one, sir." The captive Americans now came forward to greet and bless
their deliverer.<a id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">117</sup></a> Surely this moment&mdash;when he looked upon his
emancipated fellow-countrymen, and thought how much he had contributed
to overthrow the relentless system of bondage under which they had
groaned&mdash;must have been one of the sweetest in the life of that hardy
son of the sea. But should I not say, even here, that there is now a
citizen of Massachusetts, who, without army or navy, by a simple act of
self-renunciation, has given freedom to a larger number of Christian
American slaves than was done by the sword of Decatur?</p>


<p>Thus, not by money, but by arms, was emancipation this time secured. The
country was grateful for the result; though the poor freedmen, ingulfed
in the unknown wastes of ocean, on their glad passage home, were never
able to mingle joys with their fellow-citizens. They were lost in the
Epervier, of which no trace has ever appeared. Nor did the people feel
the melancholy mockery in the conduct of the government, which, having
weakly declared that it "was not in any sense founded on the Christian
religion," now expressly confined the protecting power of its flag to
fugitive "Christians, captives in Algiers," leaving slaves of another
faith to be snatched as between the horns of the altar, and returned to
the continued horrors of their lot.</p>

<p>The success of the American arms was followed speedily by a more signal
triumph of Great Britain, acting generously in behalf of all the
Christian powers. Her expedition was debated, perhaps prompted, in the
Congress of Vienna, where, after the overthrow of Napoleon, the
brilliant representatives of the different states of Europe, in the
presence of the monarchs of Austria, Prussia, and Russia, were assembled
to consider the evils proper to be remedied by joint action, and to
adjust the disordered balance of empire. Among many high concerns, here
entertained, was the project of a crusade against the Barbary States, in
order to accomplish the complete abolition of Christian slavery there
practised. For this purpose, it was proposed to form "a holy league."
This was earnestly enforced by a memoir from Sir Sidney Smith, the same
who foiled Napoleon at Acre, and who at this time was president of an
association called the "Knights Liberators of the <i>White</i> Slaves in
Africa,"&mdash;in our day it might be called an Abolition Society,&mdash;thus
adding to the doubtful laurels of war the true glory of striving for the
freedom of his fellow-men.<a id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">118</sup></a></p>




<p>This project, though not adopted by the Congress, awakened a generous
echo in the public mind. Various advocates appeared in its behalf; and
what the Congress failed to undertake was now especially urged upon
Great Britain, by the agents of Spain and Portugal, who insisted, that,
<i>because</i> this nation had abolished the negro slave trade, it was her
<i>duty</i> to put an end to the slavery of the <i>whites</i>.<a id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">119</sup></a></p>


<p>A disgraceful impediment seemed at first to interfere. There was a
common belief that the obstructions of the Barbary States, in the
navigation of the Mediterranean, were advantageous to British commerce,
by thwarting and strangling that of other countries; and that therefore
Great Britain, ever anxious for commercial supremacy, would rather
encourage them than seek their overthrow&mdash;the love of trade prevailing
over the love of man.<a id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">120</sup></a> This suggestion of a sordid selfishness,
which was willing to coin money out of the lives and liberties of
fellow-Christians, was soon answered.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the year 1816, Lord Exmouth, who, as Sir Edward
Pellew, had already acquired distinction in the British navy, was
despatched with a squadron to Algiers. By his general orders, bearing
date, Boyne, Port Mahon, March 21, 1816, he announced the object of his
expedition as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"He has been instructed and directed by his Royal Highness, the Prince
Regent, to proceed with the fleet to Algiers, and <i>there make certain
arrangements for diminishing, at least</i>, the piratical excursions of the
Barbary States, <i>by which thousands of our fellow-creatures, innocently
following their commercial pursuits, have been dragged into the most
wretched and revolting state of slavery</i>.</p>

<p>"The commander-in-chief is confident that <i>this outrageous system of
piracy and slavery rouses in common the same spirit of indignation which
he himself feels</i>; and should the government of Algiers refuse the
reasonable demands he bears from the Prince Regent, he doubts not but
the flag will be honorably and zealously supported by every officer and
man under his command, in his endeavors to procure the acceptation of
them by force; and <i>if force must be resorted to, we have the
consolation of knowing that we fight in the sacred cause of humanity,
and cannot fail of success</i>."<a id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">121</sup></a></p>
</div>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image31.jpg" width="298" height="200" alt="" />
</div>


<p>The moderate object of his mission was readily obtained. "Arrangements
for diminishing the piratical excursions of the Barbary States" were
established. Certain Ionian slaves, claimed as British subjects, were
released, and peace was secured for Naples and Sardinia&mdash;the former
paying a ransom of five hundred dollars, and the latter of three hundred
dollars, a head, for their subjects liberated from bondage. This was at
Algiers. Lord Exmouth next proceeded to Tunis and Tripoli, where, acting
beyond his instructions, he obtained from both these piratical
governments a promise to abolish Christian slavery within their
dominions. In one of his letters on this event, he says that, in
pressing these concessions, he "acted solely on his own responsibility
and without orders, the causes and reasoning on which, upon general
principles, may be defensible; but, as applying to our own country, may
not be borne out, <i>the old mercantile interest being against it</i>."<a id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">122</sup></a>
A similar distrust had been excited in another age by a similar
achievement. Admiral Blake, in the time of Cromwell, after his attack
upon Tunis, writing to his government at home, said, "And now, seeing it

Thus, more than once in the history of these efforts to abolish White
Slavery, did commerce, the daughter of freedom, fall under the foul
suspicion of disloyalty to her parent!</p>



<p>Lord Exmouth did injustice to the moral sense of England. His conduct
was sustained and applauded, not only in the House of Commons, but by
the public at large. He was soon directed to return to Algiers,&mdash;which
had failed to make any general renunciation of the custom of enslaving
Christians,&mdash;to extort by force such a stipulation. This expedition is
regarded by British historians with peculiar pride. In all the annals of
their triumphant navy, there is none in which the barbarism of war seems
so much "to smooth its wrinkled front." With a fleet complete at all
points, the Admiral set sail July 25, 1816, on what was deemed a holy
war. With five line-of-battle ships, five heavy frigates, four bomb
vessels, and five gun brigs, besides a Dutch fleet of five frigates and
a corvette, under Admiral Van de Capellan,&mdash;who, on learning the object
of the expedition, solicited and obtained leave to coöperate,&mdash;on the
27th of August he anchored before the formidable fortifications of
Algiers. It would not be agreeable or instructive to dwell on the scene
of desolation and blood which ensued. Before night the fleet fired,
besides shells and rockets, one hundred and eighteen tons of powder, and
fifty thousand shot, weighing more than five hundred tons. The citadel
and massive batteries of Algiers were shattered and crumbled to ruins.
The storehouses, ships, and gun boats were in flames, while the blazing
lightnings of battle were answered, in a storm of signal fury, by the
lightnings of heaven. The power of the Great Slave Dealer was humbled.</p>

<p>The terms of submission were announced to his fleet by the Admiral in
an order, dated, Queen Charlotte, Algiers Bay, August 30, 1816, which
may be read with truer pleasure than any in military or naval history.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The commander-in-chief," he said, "is happy to inform the fleet of the
final termination of their strenuous exertions, by the signature of
peace, confirmed under a salute of twenty-one guns, on the following
conditions, dictated by his Royal Highness, the Prince Regent of
England.</p>

<p>"<i>First.</i> THE ABOLITION OF CHRISTIAN SLAVERY FOREVER.</p>

<p>"<i>Second.</i> The delivery to my flag of all slaves in the dominions of the
Dey, to whatever nation they may belong, at noon to-morrow.</p>

<p>"<i>Third.</i> To deliver also to my flag all money received by him for the
redemption of slaves since the commencement of this year, at noon also
to-morrow."</p></div>

<p>On the next day, twelve hundred slaves were emancipated, making, with
those liberated in his earlier expedition, more than three thousand,
whom, by address or force, Lord Exmouth had delivered from bondage.<a id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">124</sup></a></p>


<p>Thus ended White Slavery in the Barbary States. It had already died out
in Morocco. It had been quietly renounced by Tripoli and Tunis. Its last
retreat was Algiers, whence it was driven amidst the thunder of the
British cannon.</p>


<p>Signal honors now awaited the Admiral. He was elevated to a new rank in
the peerage, and on his coat of arms was emblazoned a figure never
before known in heraldry&mdash;<i>a Christian slave holding aloft the cross and
dropping his broken fetters</i>.<a id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">125</sup></a> From the officers of the squadron he
received a costly service of plate, with an inscription, in testimony of
"the memorable victory gained at Algiers, <i>where the great cause of
Christian freedom was bravely fought and nobly accomplished</i>."<a id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">126</sup></a> But
higher far than honor were the rich personal satisfactions which he
derived from contemplating the nature of the cause in which he had been
enlisted. In his despatch to the government, describing the battle, and
written at the time, he says, in words which may be felt by others,
engaged, like him, against slavery, "In all the vicissitudes of a long
life of public service, no circumstance has ever produced on my mind
such impressions of gratitude as the event of yesterday. <i>To have been
one of the humble instruments in the hands of divine Providence for
bringing to reason a ferocious government, and destroying forever the
insufferable and horrid system of Christian slavery, can never cease to
be a source of delight and heartfelt comfort to every individual happy
enough to be employed in it.</i>"<a id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">127</sup></a></p>

</div>


<p>The reverses of Algiers did not end here. Christian slavery was
abolished; but, in 1830, the insolence of this barbarian government
aroused the vengeance of France to take military possession of the whole
country. Algiers capitulated, the Dey abdicated, and this considerable
state became a French colony.</p>

<p>Thus I have endeavored to present what I could glean in various fields
on the <i>history</i> of Christian Slavery in the Barbary States. I have
often employed the words of others, as they seemed best calculated to
convey the exact idea of the scene, incident, or sentiment which I
wished to preserve. So doing, I have occupied much time; but I may find
my apology in the words of an English chronicler.<a id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">128</sup></a> "Algier," he
says, "were altogether unworthy so long a discourse, <i>were not the
unworthinesse worthy our consideration</i>. I meane the cruell abuse of the
Christian name, which let us for inciting our zeale and exciting our
charitie and thankfulness more deeply weigh, to releeve those in
miseries, as we may, with our paynes, prayers, purses, and all the best
meditations."</p>



<h3><span>III.</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">It is by a natural transition that I am now conducted to the
inquiry into the <i>true character</i> of the evil whose history has been
traced. And here I shall be brief.</p>

<p>The slavery of Christians by the Barbary States is regarded as an
unquestionable outrage upon humanity and justice. Nobody hesitates in
this judgment. Our liveliest sympathies attend these white
brethren&mdash;torn from their homes, the ties of family and friendship
rudely severed, parent separated from child and husband from wife,
exposed at public sale like cattle, and dependent, like cattle, upon
the uncertain will of an arbitrary taskmaster. We read of a "gentleman"
who was compelled to be the valet of the barbarian Emperor of
Morocco;<a id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">129</sup></a> and Calderon, the pride of the Spanish stage, has depicted
the miserable fate of a Portuguese prince, condemned by infidel Moors to
carry water in a garden. But the lowly in condition had their unrecorded
sorrows also, whose sum total must swell to a fearful amount. Who can
tell how many hearts have been wrung by the pangs of separation, how
many crushed by the comfortless despair of interminable bondage?
"Speaking as a Christian," says the good Catholic father who has
chronicled much of this misery, "if on the earth there can be any
condition which, in its character and evils, may represent in any manner
the dolorous passion of the Son of God, (which exceeded all evils and
torments, because by it the Lord suffered every kind of evil and
affliction,) it is, beyond question and doubt, none other than slavery
and captivity in Algiers and Barbary, whose infinite evils, terrible
torments, miseries without number, afflictions without mitigation, it is
impossible to comprehend in a brief span of time."<a id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">130</sup></a> When we
consider the author's character, as a father of the Catholic Church, it
will be felt that language can no further go.</p>

</div>

<p>In nothing are the impiety and blasphemy of this custom more apparent
than in the auctions of human beings, where men were sold to the highest
bidder. Through the personal experience of a young English merchant,
Abraham Brown, afterwards a settler in Massachusetts, we may learn how
these were conducted. In 1655, before the liberating power of Cromwell
had been acknowledged, he was captured, together with a whole crew, and
carried into Sallee. His own words, in his memoirs still preserved, will
best tell his story.<a id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">131</sup></a> "On landing," he says, "an exceeding great
company of most dismal spectators were led to behold us in our
captivated condition. There was liberty for all sorts to come and look
on us, that whosoever had a mind to buy any of us on the day appointed
for our sale together in the market, might see, as I may say, what they
would like to have for their money; whereby we had too many comfortless
visitors, both from the town and country, one saying he would buy this
man, and the other that. To comfort us, we were told by the Christian
slaves already there, if we met with such and such patrons, our usage
would not be so bad as we supposed; though, indeed, our men found the
usage of the best bad enough. Fresh victuals and bread were supplied, I
suppose to feed us up for the market, that we might be in some good
plight against the day we were to be sold. And now I come to speak of
our being sold into this doleful slavery. It was doleful in respect to
the time and manner. As to the time, it was on our Sabbath day, in the
morning, about the time the people of God were about to enjoy the
liberty of God's house; this was the time our bondage was confirmed.
Again, it was sad in respect to the manner of our selling. Being all of
us brought into the market-place, we were led about, two or three at a
time, in the midst of a great concourse of people, both from the town
and country, who had a full sight of us, and if that did not satisfy,
they would come and feel of your hand, and look into your mouth to see
whether you are sound in health, or to see, by the hardness of your
hand, whether you have been a laborer or not. The manner of buying is
this: He that bids the greatest price hath you; they bidding one upon
another until the highest has you for a slave, whoever he is, or
wherever he dwells. As concerning myself, being brought to the market in
the weakest condition of any of our men, I was led forth among the cruel
multitude to be sold. As yet being undiscovered what I was, I was like
to have been sold at a very low rate, not above £15 sterling, whereas
our ordinary seamen were sold for £30 and £35 sterling, and two boys were sold for £40
apiece; and being in this sad posture led up and down at least one hour
and a half, during which time a Dutchman, that was our carpenter,
discovered me to some Jews, they increased from £15 to £75, which was
the price my patron gave for me, being 300 ducats; and had I not been so
weakened, and in these rags, (indeed, I made myself more so than I was,
for sometimes, as they led me, I pretended I could not go, and did often
sit down;) I say, had not these things been, in all likelihood I had
been sold for as much again in the market, and thus I had been dearer,
and the difficulty greater to be redeemed. During the time of my being
led up and down the market, I was possessed with the greatest fears, not
knowing who my patron might be. I feared it might be one from the
country, who would carry me where I could not return, or it might be one
in and about Sallee, of which we had sad accounts; and many other
distracting thoughts I had. And though I was like to have been sold
unto the most cruel man in Sallee, there being but one piece of eight
between him and my patron, yet the Lord was pleased to cause him to buy
me, of whom I may speak, to the glory of God, as the kindest man in the
place."</p>



<p>This is the story of a respectable person, little distinguished in the
world. But the slave dealer applied his inexorable system without
distinction of persons. The experiences of St. Vincent de Paul did not
differ from those of Abraham Brown. That eminent character, admired,
beloved and worshipped by large circles of mankind, has also left a
record of his sale as a slave.<a id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">132</sup></a> "Their proceedings," he says, "at
our sale were as follows: After we had been stripped, they gave to each
one of us a pair of drawers, a linen coat, with a cap, and paraded us
through the city of Tunis, where they had come expressly to sell us.
Having made us make five or six turns through the city, with the chain
at our necks, they conducted us back to the boat, that the merchants
might come to see who could eat well, and who not; and to show that our
wounds were not mortal. This done, they took us to the public square,
where the merchants came to visit us, precisely as they do at the
purchase of a horse or of cattle, making us open the mouth to see our
teeth, feeling our sides, searching our wounds, and making us move our
steps, trot and run, then lift burdens, and then wrestle, in order to
see the strength of each, and a thousand other sorts of brutalities."</p>


<p>And here we may refer again to Cervantes, whose pen was dipped in his
own dark experience. In his Life in Algiers, he has displayed the
horrors of the white slave market. The public crier exposes for sale a
father and mother with their two children. They are to be sold
separately, or, according to the language of our day, "in lots to suit
purchasers." The father is resigned, confiding in God; the mother sobs;
while the children, ignorant of the inhumanity of men, show an
instinctive trust in the constant and wakeful protection of their
parents&mdash;now, alas! impotent to shield them from dire calamity. A
merchant, inclining to purchase one of the "little ones," and wishing to
ascertain his bodily condition, causes him to open his mouth. The child,
still ignorant of the doom which awaits him, imagines that the inquirer
is about to extract a tooth, and, assuring him that it does not ache,
begs him to desist. The merchant, in other respects an estimable man,
pays one hundred and thirty dollars for the youngest child, and the sale
is completed. Thus a human being&mdash;one of those children of whom it has
been said, "Of such is the kingdom of heaven"&mdash;is profanely treated as
an article of merchandise, and torn far away from a mother's arms and a
father's support. The hardening influence of custom has steeled the
merchant into insensibility to this violation of humanity and justice,
this laceration of sacred ties, this degradation of the image of God.
The unconscious heartlessness of the slave dealer, and the anguish of
his victims, are depicted in the dialogue which ensues after the
sale.<a id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">133</sup></a></p>

<p>From this scene we gladly avert the countenance, while, from the bottom
of our hearts, we send our sympathies to the unhappy sufferers. Fain
would we avert their fate; fain would we destroy the system of slavery,
that has made them wretched and their masters cruel. And yet we would
not judge with harshness an Algerine slave owner. He has been reared in
a religion of slavery; he has learned to regard Christians, "guilty of a
skin not colored like his own," as lawful prey; and has found sanctions
for his conduct in the injunctions of the Koran, in the custom of his
country, and in the instinctive dictates of an imagined self-interest.
It is, then, the "peculiar institution" which we are aroused to
execrate, rather than the Algerine slave masters, who glory in its
influence, and,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i6">so perfect is their misery,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not once perceive their foul disfigurement,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But boast themselves more comely than before.</span>
</div>


<p>But there is reason to believe that the sufferings of the white slaves
were not often greater than is the natural incident of slavery. There is
an important authority which presents this point in an interesting
light. It is that of General Eaton, for some time consul of the United
States at Tunis, and whose name is not without note in the painful
annals of war. In a letter to his wife, dated at Tunis, April 6, 1799,
and written amidst opportunities of observation such as few have
enjoyed, he briefly describes the condition of this unhappy class,
illustrating it by a comparison less flattering to our country than to
Barbary. "Many of the Christian slaves," he says, "have died of grief,
and the others linger out a life less tolerable than death. Alas!
remorse seizes my whole soul, when I reflect that this is, indeed, a
copy of the very barbarity which my eyes have seen in my own native
country. And yet we boast of liberty and national justice. How
frequently have I seen in the Southern States of our own country weeping
mothers leading guiltless infants to the sales with as deep anguish as
if they led them to the slaughter, and yet felt my bosom tranquil in the
view of these aggressions upon defenceless humanity! But when I see the
same enormities practised upon beings whose complexion and blood claim
kindred with my own, I curse the perpetrators, and weep over the
wretched victims of their rapacity. <i>Indeed, truth and justice demand
from me the confession that the Christian slaves among the barbarians of
Africa are treated with more humanity than the African slaves among the
professing Christians of civilized America</i>; and yet here sensibility
bleeds at every pore for the wretches whom fate has doomed to
slavery."<a id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">134</sup></a></p>

<p>Such testimony would seem to furnish a decisive standard or measure of
comparison by which to determine the character of White Slavery in the
Barbary States. But there are other considerations and authorities. One
of these is the influence of the religion of these barbarians.
Travellers remark the generally kind treatment bestowed by Mohammedans
upon slaves.<a id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">135</sup></a> The lash rarely, if ever, lacerates the back of the
female; the knife or branding iron is not employed upon any human being
to mark him as the property of his fellow-man. Nor is the slave doomed,
as in other countries, where the Christian religion is professed, to
unconditional and perpetual service, without prospect of <i>redemption</i>.
Hope, the last friend of misfortune, may brighten his captivity. He is
not so walled around by inhuman institutions as to be inaccessible to
freedom. "And unto such of your slaves," says the Koran, in words worthy
of adoption in the legislation of Christian countries, "as desire a
written instrument, allowing them to redeem themselves on paying a
certain sum, write one, if ye know good in them, and give them of the
riches of God, which he hath given you."<a id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">136</sup></a> Thus from the Koran, which
ordains slavery, come lessons of benignity to the slave; and one of the
most touching stories in Mohammedanism is of the generosity of Ali, the
companion of the Prophet, who, after fasting for three days, gave his
whole provision to a captive not more famished than himself.<a id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">137</sup></a></p>



<p>Such precepts and examples doubtless had their influence in Algiers. It
is evident, from the history of the country, that the prejudice of race
did not so far prevail as to stamp upon the slaves and their descendants
any indelible mark of exclusion from power and influence. It often
happened that they arrived at eminent posts in the state. The seat of
the Deys, more than once, was filled by humble Christian captives, who
had tugged for years at the oar.<a id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">138</sup></a></p>


<p>Nor do we feel, from the narratives of captives and of travellers, that
the condition of the Christian slave was rigorous beyond the ordinary
lot of slavery. "The Captive's Story" in Don Quixote fails to impress
the reader with any peculiar horror of the life from which he had
escaped. It is often said that the sufferings of Cervantes were among
the most severe which even Algiers could inflict.<a id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">139</sup></a> But they did not
repress the gayety of his temper; and we learn that in the building
where he was confined there was a chapel or oratory, in which mass was
celebrated, the sacrament administered, and sermons regularly preached
by captive priests.<a id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">140</sup></a> Nor was this all. The pleasures of the theatre
were enjoyed by these slaves; and the farces of Lopé de Rueda, a
favorite Spanish dramatist of the time, served, in actual
representation, to cheer this house of bondage.<a id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">141</sup></a></p>


<p>The experience of the devoted Portuguese ecclesiastic, Father Thomas,
illustrates this lot. A slave in Morocco, he was able to minister to his
fellow-slaves, and to compose a work on the Passion of Jesus Christ,
which has been admired for its unction, and translated into various
tongues. At last liberated through the intervention of the Portuguese
ambassador, he chose to remain behind, notwithstanding the solicitations
of relatives at home, that he might continue to instruct and console the
unhappy men, his late companions in bonds.<a id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">142</sup></a></p>



<p>Even the story of St. Vincent de Paul, so brutally sold in the public
square, is not without its gleams of light. He was bought by a
fisherman, who was soon constrained to get rid of him, "having nothing
so contrary except the sea." He then passed into the hands of an old
man, whom he pleasantly describes as a chemical doctor, a sovereign
maker of quintessences, very humane and kind, who had labored for the
space of fifty years in search of the philosopher's stone. "He loved me
much," says the fugitive slave, "and pleased himself by discoursing to
me of alchemy, and then of his religion, to which he made every effort
to draw me, promising me riches and all his wisdom." On the death of
this master, he passed to a nephew, by whom he was sold to still another
person, a renegade from Nice, who took him to the mountains, where the
country was extremely hot and desert. A Turkish wife of the renegade
becoming interested in him, and curious to know his manner of life at
home, visited him daily at his work in the fields, and listened with
delight to the slave, away from his country and the churches of his
religion, as he sang the psalm of the children of Israel in a foreign
land: "By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down; yea, we wept when we
remembered Zion."<a id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">143</sup></a></p>


<div class="center">
<img src="images/image35.jpg" width="273" height="209" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The kindness of the slave master often appears. The English merchant
Abraham Brown, whose sale at Sallee has been already described, makes
known, in his memoirs, that, after he had been carried to the house of
his master, his wounds were tenderly washed and dressed by his master's
wife, and "indeed the whole family gave him comfortable words." He was
furnished with a mat to lie on, "and some three or four days after
provided with a shirt, such a one as it was, a pair of shoes, and an old
doublet." His servile toils troubled him less than "being commanded by a
negro man, who had been a long time in his patron's house a freeman, at
whose beck and command he was obliged to be obedient for the doing of
the least about the house or mill;" and he concludes his lament on this
degradation as follows: "Thus I, who had commanded many men in several
parts of the world, must now be commanded by a negro, who, with his two
countrywomen in the house, scorned to drink out of the water pot I drank
of, whereby I was despised of the despised people of the world."<a id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">144</sup></a></p>

<p>At a later day we are furnished with another authentic picture. Captain
Braithwaite, who accompanied the British minister to Morocco in 1727, in
order to procure the liberation of the British captives, after
describing their comfortable condition, adds, "I am sure we saw several
captives who lived much better in Barbary than ever they did in their
own country. Whatever money in charity was sent them by their friends in
Europe was their own, unless they defrauded one another, which has
happened much oftener than by the Moors. Several of them are rich, and
many have carried considerable sums out of the country, to the truth of
which we are all witnesses. Several captives keep their mules, and some
their servants; and yet this is called insupportable slavery among Turks
and Moors. But we found this, as well as many other things in this
country, strangely misrepresented."<a id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">145</sup></a></p>

<p>These statements&mdash;which, to those who do not place freedom above all
price, may seem, at first view, to take the sting even from slavery&mdash;are
not without support from other sources. Colonel Keatinge, who, as a
member of a diplomatic mission from England, visited Morocco in 1785,
says of this evil there, that "it is very slightly inflicted, and as to
any labor undergone, it does not deserve the name;"<a id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">146</sup></a> while Mr.
Lemprière, who was in the same country not long afterwards, adds, "To
the disgrace of Europe, the Moors treat their slaves with
humanity."<a id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">147</sup></a> In Tripoli, we are told, by a person for ten years a
resident, that the same gentleness prevailed. "It is a great alleviation
to our feelings," says the writer, speaking of the slaves, "to see them
easy and well dressed, and, so far from wearing chains, as captives do
in most other places, they are perfectly at liberty."<a id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">148</sup></a> We have
already seen the testimony of General Eaton with regard to slavery in
Tunis; while Mr. Noah, one of his successors in the consulate of the
United States at that place, says, "In Tunis, from my observation, the
slaves are not severely treated; they are very useful, and many of them
have made money."<a id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">149</sup></a> And Mr. Shaler, describing the chief seat of
Christian slavery, says, "In short, there were slaves who left Algiers
with regret."<a id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">150</sup></a></p>





<p>A French writer of more recent date asserts with some vehemence, and
with the authority of an eye witness, that the Christian slaves at
Algiers were not exposed to the miseries which they represented. I do
not know that he vindicates their slavery, but, like Captain
Braithwaite, he evidently regards many of them as better off than they
would be at home. According to him, they were well clad and well fed,
<i>much better than the free Christians there</i>. The youngest and most
comely were taken as pages by the Dey. Others were employed in the
barracks; others in the galleys; but even here there was a chapel, as in
the time of Cervantes, for the free exercise of the Christian religion.
Those who happened to be artisans, as carpenters, locksmiths, and
calkers, were let to the owners of vessels. Others were employed on the
public works; while others still were allowed the privilege of keeping a
shop, in which their profits were sometimes so large as to enable them
at the end of a year to purchase their ransom. But these were often
known to become indifferent to freedom, and to prefer Algiers to their
own country. The slaves of private persons were sometimes employed in
the family of their master, where their treatment necessarily depended
much upon his character. If he were gentle and humane, their lot was
fortunate; they were regarded as children of the house. If he were harsh
and selfish, then the iron of slavery did, indeed, enter their souls.
Many were bought to be sold again for profit into distant parts of the
country, where they were doomed to exhausting labor; in which event
their condition was most grievous. But special care was bestowed upon
all who became ill&mdash;not so much, it is admitted, from humanity as
through fear of losing them.<a id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">151</sup></a></p>


<p>But, whatever deductions may be made from the familiar stories of White
Slavery in the Barbary States,&mdash;admitting that it was mitigated by the
genial influence of Mohammedanism,&mdash;that the captives were well clad and
well fed, much better than the free Christians there,&mdash;that they were
allowed opportunities of Christian worship,&mdash;that they were often
treated with lenity and affectionate care,&mdash;that they were sometimes
advanced to posts of responsibility and honor,&mdash;and that they were
known, in their contentment or stolidity, to become indifferent to
freedom,&mdash;still the institution or custom is hardly less hateful in our
eyes. Slavery in all its forms, even under the mildest influences, is a
wrong and a curse. No accidental gentleness of the master can make it
otherwise. Against it reason, experience, the heart of man, all cry out.
"Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still, Slavery! thou art a bitter
draught! and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink of
thee, thou art no less bitter on that account." Algerine Slavery was a
violation of the law of nature and of God. It was a usurpation of rights
not granted to man.</p>

<p class="noindent">Such a relation, in defiance of God, could not fail to accumulate
disastrous consequences upon all in any way parties to it; for injustice
and wrong are fatal alike to the doer and the sufferer. It is notorious
that, in Algiers, it exerted a most pernicious influence on master as
well as slave. The slave was crushed and degraded, his intelligence
abased, even his love of freedom extinguished. The master, accustomed
from childhood to revolting inequalities of condition, was exalted into
a mood of unconscious arrogance and self-confidence, inconsistent with
the virtues of a pure and upright character. Unlimited power is apt to
stretch towards license; and the wives and daughters of Christian slaves
were often pressed to be the concubines of their Algerine masters.<a id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">153</sup></a></p>


<p>It is well, then, that it has passed away! The Barbary States seem less
barbarous, when we no longer discern this cruel oppression!</p>

<p>But the story of slavery there is not yet all told. While the Barbary
States received white slaves by sea, stolen by corsairs, they also, from
time immemorial, imported black slaves from the south. Over the vast,
illimitable sea of sand, in which is absorbed their southern
border,&mdash;traversed by camels, those "ships of the desert,"&mdash;were brought
those unfortunate beings, as merchandise, with gold dust and ivory,
doomed often to insufferable torments, while cruel thirst parched the
lips, and tears vainly moistened the eyes. They also were ravished from
their homes, and, like their white brethren from the north, compelled to
taste of slavery. In numbers they have far surpassed their Christian
peers. But for long years no pen or voice pleaded their cause; nor did
the Christian nations&mdash;professing a religion which teaches universal
humanity, without respect of persons, and sends the precious sympathies
of neighborhood to all who suffer, even at the farthest pole&mdash;ever
interfere in any way in their behalf. The navy of Great Britain, by the
throats of their artillery, argued the freedom of all
<i>fellow-Christians</i>, without distinction of <i>nation</i>; but they heeded
not the slavery of other brethren in bonds&mdash;Mohammedans or idolaters,
children of the same Father in heaven. Lord Exmouth did but half his
work. In confining the stipulation to the abolition of Christian slavery
only, this Abolitionist made a discrimination, which, whether founded on
religion or color, was selfish and unchristian. Here, again, was the
same inconsistency which darkened the conduct of Charles the Fifth, and
has constantly recurred throughout the history of this outrage.
Forgetful of the Brotherhood of the Race, Christian powers have deemed
the slavery of blacks just and proper, while the slavery of whites has
been branded as unjust and sinful.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/image36.jpg" width="368" height="198" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As the British fleet sailed proudly from the harbor of Algiers, bearing
its emancipated white slaves, and the express stipulation, that
Christian slavery was abolished there forever, it left behind in bondage
large numbers of blacks, distributed throughout all the Barbary States.
Neglected thus by exclusive and unchristian Christendom, it is pleasant
to know that their lot is not always unhappy. In Morocco, negroes are
still detained as slaves; but the prejudice of color seems not to
prevail there. They have been called "the grand cavaliers of this part
of Barbary."<a id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">154</sup></a> They often become the chief magistrates and rulers of
cities.<a id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">155</sup></a> They constituted the body guard of several of the emperors,
and, on one occasion at least, exercised the prerogative of the
Prætorian cohorts, in dethroning their master.<a id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">156</sup></a> If negro slavery
still exists in this state, it has little of the degradation connected
with it elsewhere. Into Algiers France has already carried the benign
principle of law&mdash;earlier recognized by her than by the English
courts<a id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor"><sup class="topnum">157</sup></a>&mdash;which secures freedom to all beneath its influence. And now
we are cheered anew by the glad tidings recently received, that the Bey
of Tunis, "for the glory of God, and to distinguish man from the brute
creation," has decreed the total abolition of human slavery throughout
his dominions.</p>


<p>Let us, then, with hope and confidence, turn to the Barbary States! The
virtues and charities do not come singly. Among them is a common bond,
stronger than that of science or knowledge. Let one find admission, and
a goodly troop will follow. Nor is it unreasonable to anticipate other
improvements in states which have renounced a long-cherished system of
White Slavery, while they have done much to abolish or mitigate the
slavery of others not white, and to overcome the inhuman prejudice of
color. The Christian nations of Europe first declared, and practically
enforced, within their own European dominions, the vital truth of
freedom, that man cannot hold property in his brother man. Algiers and
Tunis, like Saul of Tarsus, have been turned from the path of
persecution, and now receive the same faith. Algiers and Tunis now help
to plead the cause of Freedom. Such a cause is in sacred fellowship with
all those principles which promote the Progress of Man. And who can tell
that this despised portion of the globe is not destined to yet another
restoration? It was here in Northern Africa that civilization was first
nursed, that commerce early spread her white wings, that Christianity
was taught by the honeyed lips of Augustine. All these are again
returning to their ancient home. Civilization, commerce, and
Christianity once more shed their benignant influences upon the land to
which they have long been strangers. A new health and vigor now animate
its exertions. Like its own giant Antæus,&mdash;whose tomb is placed by
tradition among the hillsides of Algiers,&mdash;it has been often felled to
the earth, but it now rises with renewed strength, to gain yet higher
victories.</p>

earliest instance of the <i>bombardment</i> of a town. Sismondi, who never
fails to regard the past in the light of humanity, says, that "Louis the
Fourteenth was the first to put in practice the atrocious method, newly
invented, of bombarding towns,&mdash;of burning them, not to take them, but
to destroy them,&mdash;<i>of attacking, not fortifications, but private
houses,&mdash;not soldiers, but peaceable inhabitants, women and children,
and of confounding thousands of private crimes, each one of which would
cause horror, in one great public crime, one great disaster, which he
regarded only as one of the catastrophes of war</i>." Sismondi, <i>Histoire
des Français</i>, tom. xxv. p. 452. How much of this is justly applicable
to the recent murder of women and children by the forces of the United
States at Vera Cruz! Algiers was bombarded in the cause of <i>freedom</i>;
Vera Cruz to extend <i>slavery</i>!</p></div>

of Morocco, London, 1729.</i> This contains a journal of the mission of
John Russel, Esq., from the English government to Morocco, to obtain the
liberation of slaves. The expedition was thoroughly equipped. "The
Moors," says the author, "find plenty of every thing but drink, but for
that the English generally take care of themselves; for, besides chairs,
tables, knives, forks, plates, table linen, &amp;c., we had two or three

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
